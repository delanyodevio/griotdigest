summary: Love they say is blind but the demands of her love for me is too huge
  to rest on the shoulders of mine. Since when has blinds become so demanding?

We are best friends in the eyes of our observers but worst enemies in our own minds. We feel so integrated in the face of societal disintegrations but strangers in our own abode.

'You're too difficult' but to me, feeble men are many. "Your are well endowed with intellects but less endowed with marital qualities." "You're irreplaceable" but she replaces my dreams with illusions from afar.

She leaves in me a vacuum that can be evacuated forever! She befriends my feelings but unfriends my dreams.

Whose arms are you falling into?

Does the person supports and protects your dreams?

Love is deceptive!

Love is blind!
