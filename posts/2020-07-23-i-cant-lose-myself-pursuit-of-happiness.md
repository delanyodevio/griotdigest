Sorry that I may appear selfish
Sorry that I want more of me
Sorry that I want to love me some more
Sorry that I want more space for myself
Sorry that when I look into the mirror all I want to see is the true me
Sorry that I want to get better for me
Sorry that I think of myself more
Sorry that I put in my all when it comes to me
Sorry that I want to feel good for myself
Sorry that I want to achieve more for me
Sorry that I want to have peace with me
Sorry that I want to give me more smiles
Sorry that I matter more to myself
Sorry that I won't lose myself for you
Sorry that I want to be happy for me
Sorry that I won't make you my stressor.
Sorry that I am my own immune booster
Sorry that I come first before anything
Sorry that I can't love me less
Sorry that I can't love you over me
Sorry that am ready to repeat these mistakes about me.
But sorry for not being sorry because in all things, look to yourself first.
