Social media and the Internet as a whole has now become a tool that can sharpen up our skills promotes talents and ignite the untapped potentials within us. Your are either continue to fall for lame hypes or get real and do
the real work for your efforts to pay off as long as your system established.

In your country if your are coming from a family where your parents are not in the A-list citizens, you should know that there is no time to tolerate trash stories. Well, the most social media platforms are now more than a country, and there are various types of citizens; A-list citizens, B-list citizens and so on. What others don't know is that, those classes of citizens are also economically bound. The opportunities for various types of citizens are far much different.

But to me and you that shouldn't be the case. Social media is now more a business platform than social platform. Businesses have already realised the potential of social media platforms to; reach prospective customers, interact with loyal customers, advertise their products, study the needs of their customers through social surveys, close deals and directly sell their products, and most importantly establish strong brands.

But what about me and you? A regular user that visits [Facebook](facebook.com), [Twitter](twitter.com), [Instagram](instagram.com), [Youtube](youtube.com), and the rest. And reads comments, watches videos, loves pics, shares birthdays. What can we do for us also to tap into these potentials? This is a question I want to answer. Here, I listed down various ways, a regular user like me and you, to do to be winning on social media platforms.
