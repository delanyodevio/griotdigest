summary: never underestimate the strength of a woman.
---

according to the bible, the last of all creation was the woman. this is significant because in tradition we believe all must be present before the important guest arrives during an occasion. and the game changer was set to arrive.

what differentiates women from men is not the muscle, bone, etc. it's the ability to be resistant and resilient. the strength of a man is usually in his physical body but women usually have it in their spirit.

every month the woman goes through a cycle i call death and resurrection. yes at least every 3 days in a month, her body goes through an excruciating torture by mother nature **(menstruation)** for her benefit. a torture that will prepare her to give life to another. a torture that will put her in charge to continue God's creation. a period where she curses the day she was made, where she wishes for death but it seems close and far. a time where she wishes she was a man instead. a moment where she questions her creator with cries, **_"what have i done to deserve such pain"?_** and when everything is over, she answers the question herself.

the most amazing part of the pain is that, it takes her into a deep short sleep where she is recreated. she wakes up as if nothing had happened. she becomes full of **life**, **energy**, **high spirited** and at the peak of her **venom**. yes she's been refilled.

never assume women are weak. they are not, they only appear so. they are created like sweet scented edible **fruits** but their seeds can be hard and **dangerous** to swallow. women are

created for **endurance** and that is why they can endure the abuse, suppression, humiliation, etc. there is a reason why she is not easily broken. even if broken she can fix herself.

but be careful not to be the one who breaks her because she will **vent her last spleen** on you. her spirit is fearless because she dies **(blood)** and resurrects **(victory)** every month **(battle field) !** yes she got a soft skin but a**bulletproof spirit\***.\*
