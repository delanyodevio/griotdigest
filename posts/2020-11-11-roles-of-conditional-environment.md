Let's consider this obvious analogy.

1. In a very hot condition, 2 atoms of hydrogen plus 1 atom of oxygen produces steam.

1. In a mid normal condition, 2 atoms of hydrogen plus 1 atom of oxygen produces water.

1. In a very cold condition, 2 atoms of hydrogen plus 1 atom of oxygen produces ice.

Steam, water, and ice are made up of the same building blocks – same constituents, combined in almost the same way, but the environment around them profoundly shapes the form they take up.

Expectedly, not only their forms but also their behaviors are affected.

Ice is solid and hard, freezes, and can be used to ease the pain of injured athletes.

Water is a liquid, flows and can be used to satisfy thirst – one cannot drink ice.

Steam is gaseous, flows up and it's used in turning turbines and moving engines.

Same constituents, same combinatorial orientation, different environments – different results.

As environment seems to be the major player here, let us look at some facts on it.

### Environment is affected by our timing.

Every environment you find yourself is good yet how it affects you is based on the conditions and time available.

Among the three, steam is the one with higher energy. And ice is the one with more weight.

Different environment..... but produces two great things respectively – energy and weight.

And those end products (energy and weight) are good if the time is right.

Environment requires timing for it to be suitable.

### Environment is affected by our perception.

We're humans. And we're more emotional than all the other living things.

We see things differently. We appreciate things differently. We prioritize things differently.

Two people can possess same characteristics, operate in the same environment, at same time, with their results being influenced by their individual perceptions.

Think of it this way.

Taking two footballers (strikers) in a team that lost a football match. But one of them managed to score a goal.

Of course the one that scored, got a moral boost and a higher rating (perception).

Though the team lost the match, but the one that scored will be rated highly.

Same thing is perception. Having the resilient perception is essential to operate in your current environment.

Perceptions are powerful, they affect our environments. Environments affect our results.

### Environment doesn't have to be perfect.

That's the way it is – environment.

Making a perfect environment? It's still environment. Imperfect environment? Still environment.

If no condition is permanent, then no condition is perfect (a complete one).

Nothing can ever be perfect, 100% before you can start doing something.

The boiling point of water, that is temperatures above 99.9 Celsius, produces steam – good.

The negative temperature of water, which is below 0 Celsius, produces ice – good.

Everything in between is water – good.

Those things are points. And they cannot be classified as perfect or imperfect – complete or incomplete.

They're just points where changes occur.

Looking for a perfect and complete environment shouldn’t be the case at all.

### most environments execute different kinds of actions.

Take for example the web browser. The browser, which is a user agent, is an environment meant both for the developer and the end-user.

The developer develops websites using the browser. The end-user browses websites using the browser – same environment, different personalities – different results.

There are different personalities in the world.

Two people will stay in same environment with the same mindset, but having their output influenced by their personalities – in other words, their inputs.

This is not just about garbage-in-garbage-out. This is about your skill set, i.e. your direction.

The way a developer interact with the browser is quite far apart from a regular user.

### To conclude.

Though environment plays major roles in our outcomes, our timings, our personalities, our qualities, our experiences and our perspectives – all help shape our outcomes too.

We know for sure that there is no right answer. There is no universal truth.

There is only what works for you at this time and what don't work at another time.

You know yourself. You know more about your environment than anyone does.

But we also know that there are basic principles that must be adhered to. Such as:

- Having the resilient perception.

- Creating your environment based on your timing.

- Using your personality to create the best-case outcome in your current environment.

Unlike the hydrogen and oxygen analogy, we're humans, we have control, we affect our environments more than they affect us.

Because conditions will always be conditions.
