summary: "They come. They go. But I'm still here. This is what a friend told
  me concerning the things happening through her life. Yes, this life is like a tide. Periodically
  changing phases. At a point, we are running, and always busy. But it seemed we're getting nowhere."

We would wake up, check our phones, go to work, check our phones, stay busy, check our phones, sleep, and do it all over again. Some days were great, some other days were distasteful, and most were okay.

It’s easy to get carried away by being busy, reacting through life and not achieving what is most important to you. Unfortunately, it often takes something drastic to force us out of our habit patterns. Like the covid-19.

What if you could break free of the tidal nature of life with a reset—a chance once and for all to define the life you want and create a path to get there, all while building resilience along the way? Resilience is a muscle, and this is your chance to build it. Here are three strategies that will help you not only overcome tough times but grow smarter and stronger as a result.

### 1. Develop a resilient mindset

A resilient mindset is a set of conscious and unconscious beliefs that impact how you respond in trying times.

First, it helps to understand how your brain interprets stories. The human brain is built to protect you from threats. It has evolved to pick the negatives and ignore the positives.

Death. Sickness. Layoffs. We’ve all been bombarded with negative messages. These things put our brains on high alert looking for more threats to pounce. Whether we realize it or not, we are regularly priming our brain to seek out more threats, negative information, and bad scenarios.

But you can rewrite your story.

Your story could also be one of strength. You have survived the worst things that have ever happened to you. You have lost loved ones, faced career setbacks, had your heart broken, and had your share of disappointments. Yet you're still here, stronger, smarter, and more determined than ever. You can look back with perspective and see how you’ve grown.

### 2. Get a clear picture of your priority.

We complain constantly about the challenges of juggling through life. But resilient folks make sure their actions align with their intentions.

In his book, [The One Thing](https://www.pdfdrive.com/the-one-thing-the-surprisingly-simple-truth-behind-extraordinary-results-e61378074.html), Gary Keller advocates for the importance of scheduling your ultimate priority.

Granted, you have a whole slew of things to do in your lifetime. But you can do one thing in a time. When you start to whittle down your most important activities, you will just arrive at One Thing. And that's your priority.

Having a single priority to work with in any area of your life, is the power of focus. And I've found the One Thing principle very effective yet simple to apply. To truly understand this principle. Ask yourself this question (which can be scooped in any area of your life):

"What is the one thing to do (this time) to improve my (area of life) and by doing it everything else will unnecessary?"

For instance in your personal life, you can say...

- what's the ONE THING I can in 90 days to get the physical shape I want?

- what's the ONE THING I can do this year to affirm my life's purpose, and by doing it everything else will be unnecessary?

For business...

- what's the ONE THING I can do this month to produce better work?

Similar questions can be asked in the areas of family, spiritual life, community involvement, non-profit activities and in all areas of our life. The goal is to be deliberate and intentional about how and on what you invest your time on.

This is the time to do ONE THING to reconnect with family and friends. This is the time to do ONE THING that support your physical and mental health. This is the time to do ONE THING to establish your business.

Use your now time productively to get back to what is truly important.

### 3. Find unlikely moments for gratitude

Gratitude is a mood and can be practiced. The most resilient folks proactively practice positive emotions like optimism and gratitude. This gives us the chance to pick some positives even in what seems very bad.

Gratitude doesn't just make us resilient. It also helps to improve on our overall well-being. People who cultivate gratitude have improved mood, and fewer pains.

Optimism does not mean you see the world as evergreen. It means you are intentional about the way you interpret adversities in your life. Every situation, especially the tough ones, provides an opportunity to choose your interpretation. And, when we attune our attention to the good things, the positives in situations, we find more of them because we find what we’re looking for.

                • • •

Resilience is built by deliberately cultivating productive beliefs, behaviors, and habits to intentionally break out of reactivity and live purposefully. If you have found yourself in the tidal nature of life, remember to reset, and purposefully build the life you deserve. It’s about what you do starting now that matters
