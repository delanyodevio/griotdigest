With the heat level in our rooms and the cost of purchasing and running
cooling appliances, one would want to explore other avenues. There's no limit
to what the hands can do if only the mind can conceive the idea.

In our part of the world(Africa), we are faced with harsh weather conditions such as high temperatures. Although we do experience cold weather during the harmattan season(usually around New Year festive season — January), it only lasts for a short period. Thus, leaving us mostly with heat to deal with.

So, in dealing with this heat, we have to purchase air conditioners or fans. But the cost of purchasing and running air conditioner(s) is too expensive for the average person(middle class). To solve this cost issue, our appliance manufacturers came up with a portable form of air conditioner known as Air Cooler. The fan too has seen an advancement, in that, a hybrid fan known as Mist or Humidifier fan, was innovated. Thus, using the principle of air conditioner but in a mechanized form to provide almost same cooling results as experienced from normal air conditioner. Yet, the lower class person still can’t afford a mist/humidifier fan!

This brings us to the crude approach to getting a mist fan without actually buying one. How do we do this? What do we need?

The only things you need for this are fan(standing or table) and two bottles(750ml, 1L or 1.5L — depending on the size of the fan blades) of frozen water or just the bottles and ice cubes(the regular ones or the traditional ones—the solid ice block, broken into pieces). A fan is a good thing to own in itself, but unfortunately it just blows the warm air around without actually making the room much cooler. The theory behind fans is that, the breeze it creates will cool off your body when it’s slightly moist because of your sweat.

Process 1 (The Bottled Ice Water Method):

Using a table fan(whether placed on the floor or table), place the two ice-chilled water bottles in front of the fan(one to the right and the other to the left but not far beyond the arm of the fan blade). Notice that, when a bottled ice water is exposed to warm environment, it “sweats”. The breeze from the fan then blows off the “sweats” as they form on the bottles. This distributes moist air through your room. For quick or better results, sit directly opposite the fan.

Process 2 (The Plastic Bottle and Ice Cubes/Broken Ice Blocks Method) :

• Cut the base of the bottles off.

• Use hot pointed edge tool to make small holes all round the bottles from the base to the middle. Allow a centimeter distance between each small holes.

• Use binding wire or any strong rope to tie up the bottles to either side of the metal cage at the back of the fan. This should be done with the bottles facing upside down. One tie at the top and the other at the neck part of the bottles.

• Now, place the ice cubes into the bottles through the opened base. Fill it up with as much ice as you can get or can fit.

Theory :

Since the fan takes air from the back and blows it through the front, the cold droplets from the ice cubes will be pulled through the little holes in the bottle in the process of the fan drawing air from the back. This makes the air blown out through the front moist to be able to cool you down and reduce the temperature in the room. Note that, as the ice cubes melt, water will be collected at the bottom(the neck part) of the bottles. Put a cup underneath and gently open the bottle cover to allow the water to pour into the cup.

Genius, right? Try it out and let me know how it goes.
