Africa is one beautiful place that contains all that the world is
looking for. And it's not surprising that we have other races that are jealous
of us. And this jealousy has been transformed into racism centuries ago. But
it is now time for the blacks all over to unite with their home and build a
resilient continent. It is time we leave behind the bossiness and
individualism. It is time not to feel inferior. It is time to rise and defend
the black race.

When someone is jealous of you, there's a 100% chance that you're doing better than them or you have something precious that they don't have. And that's a good reason why they may be jealous of you. Jealousy is very infectious and it's rate of transmission is high and fast. If i am jealous of you, there is a way that i can transmit it to those around me so they will also dislike you. I can easily transmit it to my children, which they will also transmit to their children, and the chain goes on.

Some of us only read

about slavery in the books because we were not there in those centuries. All we can do is hold onto the stories and relive it as if it was today. We may not be old and understand so many things but at least we can observe and make analysis. It was recently that i decided to give it a thought on why the _"whites hate the blacks."_ I began to make some comparison. When you talk about beauty, the African or blacks have it all. Different shades of colors. You can find skin colors such as dark, chocolate, coffee, cream, etc. Variety of beautiful skin colors.

When it comes to talent, the blacks got it all. Be it music, sports, fashion, etc, the blacks are so good at i

t. When it comes to strength, be it physical, mental, spiritual, blacks are naturally fortified. And when it comes to wealth, the Africans are the heirs. Our land is full of gold, oil, vegetation, the waters, what ever that was used to build other continents is found in and from Africa. This shows how powerful we are.

And the best way others could beat us to it, is by whispering fear, ignorance and timidity into our ears. I presume this is what was done to our forefathers. This is the strategy the _white man_ used to weaken their immune system.

When someone is jealous of you, they will do all they can to make you feel inferior because your _confidence_ is your shield. So when that protection is taken off, all negative arrows begin to land right in your heart.

And for many centuries, the black man has felt inferior. This has really affected us to the core. We don't believe in ourselves any longer, not even our physical bodies. Even in our own land, we felt like strangers.

The black man forgot about his root, his home and his people. We forgot to unite because in unity lies strength. It is time for blacks to look beyond individualism and think of building Africa, building the continent, building the black man because that's the only way we can gain our freedom.
