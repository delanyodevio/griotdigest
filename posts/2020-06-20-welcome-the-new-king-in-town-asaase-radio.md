Gone are the days funerals and weddings were avenues for showcasing
wealth. Guess what, the status quo has been discarded. Who would ever think a
Radio Station can be ultra modern?

Asaase Radio which has been on test transmission for some days now, is allegedly owned by NPP's Gabby Otchere Darko, the right-hand man of the President. It is located on 5th Circular Rd, Cantonment—Accra.
The Radio Station is Accra's latest and ultra modern commercial radio in the country that got most people talking. The infrastructures, vehicles, setups, internal decorations and IT gadgets on display are breathe-taking! Personally I’ve never seen a Radio station extravagantly and exquisitely setup like this before. It has a dedicated walled premises, fleets of branded vehicles(even SUV's), a lot of rooms for conferences. It also have fully furnished cubicles for desk workers and a room equipped with 3-in-1 couch, divided into sort of cubicles for relaxation ( day/night sleeping place for workers and guests). It also appears to have a music production room with beat-making and recording gadgets. There’s also a set up that looks like a media training classroom. In fact, the internal decorations, art works and wall paintings are superb. Money is good indeed! A budget-less establishment(Money no be problem….Lol).

Undoubtedly, this establishment isn’t just a regular Radio Station. They definitely have a lot up their sleeves. Their Slogan is “The voice of our land” and it became fully operational with official programming on Monday 15th June, 2020.

However, before the station’s official opening, there has been rumours about the real ownership behind the Radio station. There has been fingers pointing at the President as the real owner since the “front man”, Gabby is known for taking care of the “family’s” businesses as well as taking heat for the “family” when it becomes necessary. As to how true these allegations are, only time can tell.

In the mean time, the NDC's Sammy Gyamfi has instructed his colleagues in the communication team not to engage in anything that has to do with the Radio station. He claims the station was set up with an agenda concerning the NDC party even though the station currently appears to playing the neutrality card. Also, there’s a faction that are very suspicious of the 99.5mhz transmission frequency of the station. They fear it’s too close the Joy FM's frequency (99.7mhz) hence might be an attempt to “steal” listeners from JoyFM or cause interference in their transmissions (NB: Joy Multimedia Group doesn’t seem to be inclined towards the NPP as it’s known for always putting political leaders on their toes).

From what I’ve seen, Asaase Radio is determined to capture the airwaves with business and current affairs, as well as culture, entertainment, lifestyle and sports hence we should expect more of our favourite Radio presenters joining this new station. As at now, Ms. Caroline Sampson who was recently sacked from YFM has been poached as a host for the new station. Also, the National Communication Authority (NCA) boss, Mr. Kwaku Sakyi-Addo is taking on the morning show host job there as well. This has generated a lot of heat in the public domain since he was the man at the frontline that supervised the closing down of a lot of Radio stations in the country( most of which are alleged to be Pro-NDC stations). The fears of the people is about conflict of interest as he can’t be a regulator of Radio stations at the same time working with one particular station. How can he be fair to crack the whip on Asaase Radio when he works there as well as being an ally of the owner(s)??
