Since the incidence of the Covid19 pandemic in Ghana on the 12th of March 2020, the main preventive protocol adopted by the Health Ministry is the regular hand washing with detergents under running water.

This protocol seemed easy and practicable for the privileged few who had access to running water in their homes. As such, the unprivileged masses had to find ways of making their water “running” so as to partake properly in this protocol.

Ideally, a typical rural dweller who lives alone would have opted for the traditional ways of getting his/her hands washed(with the water running) by filling his/her cheeks with water and sprinkling it on the hands while those living with others would just let someone sprinkle the water on their hands while they washed. Apparently, the former has became obsolete due to the unhygienic nature of the process hence one is left to go by the latter which, of course, has it’s flaws.

As social distancing is also part of the protocols, one wouldn’t be lucky to have someone offering to sprinkle the water in aiding the other to wash his/her hands. This is where the need arose for such people to find a sort of mechanical approach to getting their hands washed.

As expected, the resources available to such people to use in developing such a project are just household materials. So, one young man by name John, decided to use gallons, rope and wood to develop this mechanized hand washing system. The gallons filled with water and with a nozzle, is connected by a rope that is attached to a foot pedal. The gallons are hanged by a two-footed wood frame with a stick running through the handles of the gallons, serving as the holding and fulcrum point.

The water flows through the nozzle when the pedal is pressed and one can comfortably wash his/her hands under the running water. The running water then collects into a receptacle(opened gallons in this case) and is poured away when full. This, I believe, is a very impressive system. Let me know your thoughts on this in the comments section and also the various ways you think this Innovation can be improved.
