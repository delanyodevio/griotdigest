In this life you have to behave like a professional lawyer🎩. You will lose many cases and win many. If you lose a case, you don't allow it to drain you. You quickly shovel it aside and prepare for the next case with a win in mind. If you lose, move on, if you win, still move on. You can't disappoint your clients, you can't give an excuse for failing to fight their case because your previous case had weakened you. You treat each case with a new energy and hope.

You still have to appear before that same judge💂 who threw away your previous case. You don't become emotional there, you still defend your new case as if you've never met the judge. Life will continue to give you the same outcomes, the same beatings, same disappointments but you treat each day and case with different hope. You have to believe that no matter what yesterday did to you, today will deliver a different judgment, tomorrow is still up for grabs, etc. So get up, get dress, appear before that judge (world) deliver and defend your case. court rise❗❗🔨
