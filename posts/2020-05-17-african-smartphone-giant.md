Smartphone brand penetration into the African market over the years has
been very slow. Nokia and Samsung took the lead in this struggle and has
served us well until our needs shifted. Unfortunately, these two seem to lose
the fight to China's Tecno, Infinix, iTel, Huawei and Xiaomi. How did this
happen?

In Africa, more specifically Ghana, the average smart phone user who wants to buy a new smart phone is more likely to choose between Tecno, Itel or Infinix than any other smartphone brand. This has been so for sometime now because these three mobile brands are just what we needed; budget-friendly(entry-level to mid-range) devices and offer two or more GSM SIM card slots as well as packs a huge battery!

With this, one would wonder where the famous Nokia and Samsung smart phones that used to be the choices, are. The simple answer is, both brands didn’t take time to study the African markets in order to tailor their devices to suit the needs of the people. Thus, these brands produce mostly high-end devices that have only one GSM SIM slot coupled with less battery backup capacity. Notably, the African market is a very unique market. This is due to the unique factors such as poor energy supply, harsh weather, poor technological advancement and poor economic conditions of the people.

In as much as these mobile phone giants tried to tailor some models of their devices for the Global Markets while the others are region-specific, the so-called Global versions doesn’t consider the basic needs(such as number of SIM slots, battery capacity and value-added services) of these other regions. What they consider mostly is the device performance in these other regions. Also, these Giants doesn’t see the need to establish after-sales service centers in these other regions to help with warranty claims, repairs and part replacements of their faulty devices.

So, where am I going with all these? Well, If you’ve been following the design trends of smart phones, you will come to a point where you’ll wonder why there appears to be a glaring design similarities among some brands, yet we don’t hear of any legal battles between these brands regarding copyright and patent breaches. It’s one of these curiosities that led me to research into “why Tecno and Infinix smartphones are becoming similar in their designs yet none of the brands is suing the other”. The answer I got was surprising. They were all owned by one company! TRANSSION HOLDINGS, is the company behind Tecno, iTel and Infinix!

About Transsion Holdings:

Transsion Holdings (formally Tecno Telecom Limited), was incorporated in 2006 with headquarters in Shenzhen, China. It started with the Tecno brand with focus on Feature phones(what we call “Yam” phones). In 2007, Tecno created a second brand, iTel that sold in Africa. In 2010, Tecno ascended into the top three mobile phone brands in Africa alongside Samsung and Apple. In 2013, Infinix brand was added to the duo which gained market shares in Egypt, rising to third place after Samsung and Huawei in 2017 while iTel was recognized as the "most student friendly brand” in May 2017. Transsion Holdings launched it’s first smartphone in January 2012(Tecno) but only made a breakthrough in January 2014 and became the number 1 brand in major African markets in January 2015.

It’s important to note that, all these 3 brands have their specific agenda in the African market. Tecno is the premium brand(focusing more on elegant design and camera, for the working class), Infinix is the intermediate brand( focusing on productivity and battery backup, purposely for the millennials/youths) and iTel being the budget-friendly brand ( for students). Also, besides these brands running on Google’s Android Operating System, for the purposes of customizing the software to suit the needs of the people of Africa, Transsion Holdings has come out with a secondary Operating System for each brand, based on Android OS. Thus, Tecno goes with HiOS(latest version 6.0 based on Android 10), Infinix goes with XOS(latest version also being 6.0 based on Android 10) and iTel going with iTelOS(Yet to be implemented).

Moreover, latest design trends shows that, Tecno and Infinix are converging. Meaning a time will come when one wouldn’t know which particular one amongst the two to buy just because they have same or very similar designs.
