  cards or real proof of citizenship??"

The National Identification Authority (NIA) and the Government have craftily succeeded in swindling us big time. They told us not to worry about the hurried way the registration for the Ghana Card was being done because after the mass registration, district offices will be set up for those of us who couldn't get registered so we can go and register. Also, Kenneth Agyeman Attafuah (NIA Boss) was very clear when he said the Ghana Card will NOT be used for registration for the new Voter’s Card so we should relax and get registered when the district offices are in operation. This is a man that is close to the Presidency hence we trusted him. This has given most of us cold feet not to struggle for the mass registration (although most of us really tried) because there's another way of getting the card.

Alas, the registration process couldn’t even be completed in all the 16 regions of Ghana due to the incidence of the novel Covid-19 pandemic. Little did we know that, this card will be the yardstick for deciding who a Ghanaian is, in getting registered for the forthcoming new Voter's Card. Using myself as a case study, when I was registering for my Voter's Card in 2012 at my hometown (Ve Koloenu in the Afadjato South Constituency/District —Volta Region) , I had my families to guarantee for me as a Ghanaian (by birth and parentage) since I've lost my 2008 old Voter's Card (which I also got through same process as a first time registrant). Also, in obtaining my biometric birth certificate, they had my mum swear an affidavit that I'm a Ghanaian by birth and parentage (since my childhood weighing card got lost in fire).

Fast forward this 2020, per the Electoral Commission's new C.I 126 that got approved by Parliament last week, guarantors are still allowed but only this time, I'm living in a city where I have no close families to vouch for me as a Ghanaian. This means in order to get registered for the new card, I will have to look for two people who barely know me, to prove to the EC that I'm a Ghanaian. Even at this, these two people are required to have registered successfully for the new card. Unfortunately, none of the people who knows me in my neighborhood that will be motivated to vouch for me because we have a rapport, have the Ghana Card and Passport. Thus, I’m in a dilemma as to how I’ll get registered for the new Voter’s Card. More sickening is my citizenship being quashed on the basis of not having the Ghana Card and Passport. All of a sudden, I’ll be rendered a man without a country by my own country folks.

From all these, the question then is:
My old 2012 Voter's Card and/or Biometric Birth Certificate versus getting two strangers to vouch for me for the new Voter's Card, which of these makes me a genuine Ghanaian????

Is this a case of redefining citizenship?? Or just a mere case of strategic political maneuver??

Why does the EC and the Government of the day decided to plunge this peace-loving country into such a mess?? Aren’t the cries, appeals and threats of the citizens on this subject loud enough?? Why is the Government sitting on the fence and hiding behind the “independent” statute of the EC?? Doesn’t national security and peace matter anymore?? Could it be that someone or a group of persons are expected to benefit from such a chaotic situation? As people without a country (as is being decided by the EC), can one be charged for committing acts of treason ?? If this happens, who’s to blame? The aggrieved citizen, the EC or the Government??

I’m a citizen, not a spectator! Let my legally acquired old voter’s card or birth certificate count!
