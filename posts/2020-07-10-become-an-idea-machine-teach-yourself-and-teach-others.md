summary: "If you haven' found something strange during the day, it hasn't' been much of a day. - John Archibald Wheeler"
---

Well similarly, if you haven't teach something strange in a week, it hasn't been much of a week.

This life is unique. But it will always adapt to meet the demands of the environment it finds itself in.

A hard life will make a strong body.

In modern life, many of us live far from the kind of environment that would naturally shape us. So we have gyms and equipments to simulate hard labor.

And that's what we should do with our brains, too.

It is well agreed upon that if you aren't encountering something strange, something you don't understand, something you have to look up more about – then you aren't challenging your brain enough for it to grow.

And if you intend to make a living off of that BIG BEAUTIFUL BRAIN.... that's a BIG PROBLEM.

You have to push into new territory. Not necessarily new subjects, but dive deeper into your own subject(s).

How can you do that?

By cultivating a TEACHING MINDSET.

A teaching mindset is simply about you making it intentional a habit of teaching yourself and teaching others.

Anything you do. Anything you believe in. YOU CAN LEARN FASTER AND EFFECTIVELY BY TEACHING IT.

Contents that seems fresh? Solutions to problems? Answers to human pressing questions? The research? The mistakes? – turn therm to sharable (teachable) stories for yourself and for others.

YOU DON'T NEED TO BE A GURU TO DO THIS – and you don't need to be reluctant in doing this.

This is not a magic wand – THIS IS ONE OF THE NOBLEST THINGS YOU CAN DO – at no cost with your short time on earth.

Teaching as a way of learning is one area that has been covered recently. [This story](https://medium.com/accelerated-intelligence/memory-learning-breakthrough-it-turns-out-that-the-ancients-were-right-7bbd3090d9cc) by [Michael Simmons](https://www.twitter.com/michaeldsimmons) and [this story](https://www.griotstudio.com/research/education/2020/07/the-1-most-effective-learning-model-teaching-what-youre-learning) by me, both well explain why teaching your lessons – especially immediately when you learn something new – increasses and deepens your understanding level. THIS IS THE A TRANSFORMATIVE EFFECT (or EXPLANATION EFFECT).

### Teaching yourself.

Do you love yourself? Teach yourself.

One of the ways you can show love towards yourself is teaching yourself. How do you do this?

**Personal journaling:** Everyday, spend at least 15minutes to write down (in a notebook on your phone), ONE IMPORTANT, AWKWARD, STRANGE, or WEIRD experience you had. And email it to yourself. You can create two dedicated email address that you should only use for this purpose. ONE FOR SENDING, ONE FOR RECEIVING.

Write your daily or weekly life lesson reports and email it to yourself. I DARE YOU THIS SIMPLE ACTIVITY IS VERY IMPORTANT IN YOUR LIFE.

If you believe daily physical exercise is vital for your body fitness and shape, YOU'LL NOT OVERLOOK THE BRAIN.

**Talking to yourself while doing an activity:** I often found myself doing this while programming. By then I wasn't fascinated by the power behind it. Here are some case studies attesting to this truth.

- [In a study by Havard](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2414478), “employees who spent the last 15 minutes of each day of their training period writing and reflecting on what they had learned did 23% better in the final training test than other employees.”
- [Here's another study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1080/14640748308402115), found that participants who talked out loud to themselves while solving abstract logic puzzles performed three times better than those who worked in silence. These puzzles had two components that increased in difficulty; it was on the second, more difficult component that the self-talkers surpassed the silent group. The researcher concluded that talking to themselves “lead to increased awareness of past behavior, particularly of those aspects necessary for a successful solution.” In other words, the self-talkers basically taught themselves how to solve the puzzles.

You don't need to have a college degree in order to teach yourself. I believe whatever you do – **self-reflection** and **solo-conversation** during your working hours will drive your results at least by a factor of 3.

**Reading a book to solve a problem:** What's the best book in the world to read? Actually I don't know. But I believe the right book to read – is the book that will help you solve your current problem.

Books are insightful.

And reading them makes you competitively advantageous. BUT THE BEST BOOK TO READ RIGHT NOW IS THE ONE THAT WILL HELP YOU SOLVE YOUR CURRENT PROBLEM.

If you're facing a financial problem – a good finance book could help you out.

If you're facing a communication problem, like me – then [this book](https://www.pdfdrive.com/how-to-talk-to-anyone-92-little-tricks-for-big-success-in-relationships-e175339522.html) am currently reading is good for you.

I know a lot of us are avid readers. But why overwhelm yourself? And why mismatch your studies against your life problems?

One of the best ways you can read books – is to be choosy – by aligning your reading culture with your problems.

Read a book. And read it to solve a problem – your current problem.

### Teaching others.

> Knowledge is an innately social organism. It wants to move, to land in other’s minds, to connect to other knowledge. When we connect two ideas in our head into a new insight, we get a rush of bliss. Eureka! We get a second wave of bliss when we share that insight and others find it genuinely useful. Teaching is the oxygen knowledge uses to spread, grow, and thrive. We humans are designed to learn and teach. – Michael Simmons

Teaching is the leverage on which knowledge CONNECT with knowledge. What you know – you can multiply it by a factor of 9 by sharing it.

Here are the various ways you can start sharing your knowledge with others.

**Joining a mastermind club:** In his book, [Think and Grow Rich](https://www.pdfdrive.com/think-and-grow-rich-by-napoleon-hill-e15702473.html), Napoleon Hill advocates for the power of the mastermind principle.

The [Mastermind principle](https://www.google.com/search?q=the+mastermind+principle&oq=the+mastermind+principle) is a peer-to-peer mentoring group used to help members solve their problems with input and advice from the other group members. The concept was coined in 1925 by author Napoleon Hill in his book The Law of Success, and described in more detail in his 1937 book Think and Grow Rich – [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_group)

Two harmonious heads are always better than one brilliant head. Four ears are better than two ears.

The keyword is harmony.

Harmony creates beautiful melodies. BUT SUCCESS IS A TEAM SPORT.

If you want to go fast – go alone. If you want to go far – go in group. If you want to go far fast – go in harmony.

Harmony is not about not having disagreements. But it's about having a UNITED AGENDA.

This time around it's very vital for everyone to join a peer-peer mentoring mastermind group that have a united agenda of helping members solve their daily problems.

For example, [Griot Learning Tribe](https://www.facebook.com/groups/191324675632785/) is a private Facebook group for our readers to connect and share their daily or weekly lesson reports with each other.

We believe sharing one's knowledge and experience is one of the best ways to connect similar spirits and learning.

Here's another well curated group, [Building influential Brands](https://www.facebook.com/groups/buildinginfluentialbrands/). Here's a really great one, [Headstart Africa](https://www.facebook.com/groups/smartbcamp) by [smartBCamap](http://smartbcamp.com)

These groups are well curated and members share valuable lessons .

We have lots of them. If you're in any of them let me know in the comment below.

Maybe it's not your ideal to join a very large group. In that case, you can just start with close friends – people you can really feel freedom to learn and share.

**Writing on a blog:** Whether you like it or not, so far as you're on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com), [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com), and many micro-blogging sites, you're more or less blogging.

While on social media platforms you don't own the content (what you put there), you can leverage on them to blog (micro-blogging).

Though it's advisable to have your own website where you put your contents. These platforms are a good place to start.

For instance, on Facebook, you can create a page, [turn your profile into a page](https://m.facebook.com/help/116067818477568), create or join a group, create or link a group for your page. Even stories are great tools to share your lessons with others.

There's also this trend where traditional companies are seeing the power of blogging as a way to reach their customers. Because with blogging, not just you can tell [really good stories about your products](https://www.griotstudio.com/sponsor) but also, you can share lessons learned with your fans. To build a culture outside your company, consider [storytelling](https://www.griotstudio.com/sponsor).

As you fill your brain with stuffs – giving it out – to yourself and to others.

One way to quickly start this is by teaching what you already know (that's obvious) – it could be your work (what you're currently doing) or your believe (what you hold high on, or what you're following).

Chances are, you'll find similar spirits.
