summary: Our culture and traditions make us unique as Africans for that matter
  Ghanaians. The way we dress, look, talk, our food, our morals, rituals, etc
  differentiates us from others.

Even as Ghanaians, we are differentiated by our tribes therefore we may do the same thing but in different ways.

But due to technology, globalization📻✈🚗, etc most of our traditions are mixed or lost. We adopt other traditions and vice versa. And this is totally normal since no man is an island so we copy what we keep seeing. But we may end up copying both good and bad if not so careful.

There's one tradition in Ghana that has kept me thinking for so many years and thus our funeral. Since i began thinking right as an adult, i wondered why we do our funerals⚰ the way we do them🤔.

I have been wishing for things to change then boom🔥 Covid 19 happened. I have always asked myself why we waste so much money💰 on funerals? Why we adore the dead so much? Why and why and why?🤷🏻

It looks as if the best way people can show you love 💖 is when you die. You have family members who will never check up on you, they will never help you if you ask for help, but they're the first to pay for your coffin and others. We have friends that will never come to your aid even if you beg them, but they're ready to make huge donations💰💴💷💵 at your funeral. At your workplace you will struggle to get the attention of your colleagues👫 but they will be the first to cry😭 blood at your funeral. As for your neighbors, the least said the better🤦🏻. When you are sick or at the hospital, no one is ready to help you buy medications especially your extended family. But they will rush to the mortuary🏃🏼 like a tsunami💨🌀🌫 fighting over who is qualified to bath🛀🏻🚿 your dead body.

I have always wondered why we will borrow huge sums of money for funerals but cannot do same when the person is alive. Families even sell lands to hold funerals but can't do same if the person needs to travel, pay school fees or needs money for surgery. Our funerals are conducted with great joy cos that's the time for eating🍛, drinking🍻, and donations. In fact it's a good business👍🏼 venture. You are forced to buy expensive funeral clothes👗👘 sewn in the best styles so that you can also show off. People have more funeral clothes than their normal dresses and it's like a whole investment👘👗👕👖👓🕶👢👜.

The size of the funeral tells a lot about you and your family. If it's huge then the funeral is considered a befitting one. If not, it means you're poor. We're not used to a funeral ceremony with 20 to 30 people and that's why it's difficult for people to hold funerals during this covid 19 era because of the ban on mass gathering👫👬👭🚶🏾👨‍👩‍👧‍👦. We're used to crowd but that wasn't the case in the olden days. When you die, be ready to be in the morgue for 2 to 6 months as your family tries to look for funding or even build a new house to give you a befitting burial. I don't know why we can't burry within a week or 2 after death. What is so special about keeping dead bodies in the morgue for long? And at the end of the day, when they're laid is state🛌, they look so transformed and scary👺. At least why can't we bury people with few loved ones in attendance, a short ceremony, no much drama and with simple dresses. What annoys me most is the poor families who are also trying to impress others.

Why waste so much money to hire coffin dancers, people to cry at the ceremony, jama groups etc. What even pisses me off is when the body is taken from the morgue, so much queue🚙🚗🚕🚌🚑🚐🚗🚶🏾🚶🏾 with drama, borborbor group, brass band🎷🥁🎺📯, church choir, jama, etc causing unnecessary traffic🚧🚦. During wake keeping, neighbors cannot sleep due to the high volume from sound systems of the DJs🎧, it's like an earthquake🔊📢⚡. Why can't our authorities ban this🔕🔊📢❌ .

Our morgues🏥⚰ are almost full because most families are thinking about the donations they will miss if they hold funerals now with just 25 people in attendance. Yes, they're thinking about the money they will lose.

One other thing that stresses me is the long funeral services🕐 our churches hold🙅🏻. Please make it short, all the tributes by uncles, aunties, friends, enemies, side chicks, children, grandchildren, parents, grandparents, etc should be summed into one and the biography📜 of the person is enough.

Also to the families, when making obituaries why put say; children: Ama - USA, kofi - Japan, Afi - world bank, Esi - China, Yaw - Tamale, etc please what is the motive?

It's not a hidden secret in Ghana that you may be poor and hungry but the day you die, enough food and drinks will be flying around. In fact, enough for the rest to be thrown in the bins🍛🗑.

Can we halt this unnecessary, extravagant, wasteful funerals to feed and clothe our poor families as well as the society?
