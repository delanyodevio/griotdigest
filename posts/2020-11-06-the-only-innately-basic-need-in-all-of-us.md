These two words: Contentment and gratefulness – hold the key to life's satisfactory, life's appreciation and its luxury.

They do unforseen wonders and unnoticeable miracles in our lives.

When you have a contented and grateful lifestyle, you're not just at peace with yourself – but also you emits happiness – you put on a laughing face and a heart that transcends.

Contentment and gratefulness are the two foundational pillars of happiness – I believe.

But that's not all. We're also hopeful.

We're contented, but we don't want to be stagnant.

We're grateful, but we want to ask for more.

We explore. We seek. We nock. We improve. We grow.

Everyone today want to be an improvement of their yesterday. Nobody want to stay in his/her current state forever.

We always innately look for ways to develop the new version of us – for lack of growth – "state stagnation" could be a sin.

This is a good news for marketers, politicians, spiritual leaders, and teachers (knowledge makers) – for some of them from these fields use it to impact, others use it otherwise.

We don't just grow physically, but also intellectually and spiritually. We want to experience "what's new". We want a better, cleaner and saner world. 

Old stuffs hurt us. We ache inside for the anticipation. New things itch us.

At few occasions, we don't decide whether to grow or not – take physical growth for instance.

Physically, you we're born a baby, became a kid, a teen. Before you know you are in your twenties, thirties and you got married. Have a baby of your kind. And soon enough you're a mom (or dad). If life permits, then you're a grand.

Physically, you don't decide whether to grow or not.

But at most times, the story is not like that. It's survival.

### The real purpose of existence

If we walk down through the ages, we would realized that the whole purpose of existence is growth. 

At all fields, life is dynamic.

Your life, your future is of your own making.

For the only law of energy is the law of supply.

This supply is enormous but of limited time.
