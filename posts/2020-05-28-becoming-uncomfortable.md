Sometimes we need to become uncomfortable so we can also make others
comfortable. Some of us have the capacity to pull others out of the pit. We
can push others a little bit into the limelight.

We can help people to be halfway into their destiny. We can be that bridge that links others to their goals. It takes just one decision to do that. Don't wait for others to come begging you, kneel down for you, weep at your feet before you help them because tables do turn. You were blessed to be a blessing onto others so learn to have compassion for others.

Helping others may take you out of your comfort zone but that's the sacrifice someone also made to help you.

Even the bible says except a grain of wheat falls unto the ground and dies, it abideth alone.

So if you want to be greater, if you want to have more, if you want to be remembered, if you want to be adored, if you want to stay relevant, go out of your comfort zone and give a helping hand to someone today!

And to all those seeking for help, put pride aside, put fear aside, put shyness aside, master courage and seek for help ! Your breakthrough may just be a call way, may be just a friend away, may be just a shout away.

Ask for help, don't suffer alone, for God has not given us the spirit of fear, but of love, power and sound mind.

_Hold on tight, help is coming_
