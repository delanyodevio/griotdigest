Through this vague journey of life, I have come across prominent and
futuristic individuals. These people have attained self actualization and have
seen in me far beyond what I thought I could achieve.

Indeed,the one who pays respect to the great paves the way for his own greatness. On the same path of this journey,I have met people who have certainly settled for less just for survival so as their actions and associations. And they've said to me, "life is all about survival." To the best of my determination,I've realized that the state of these two groups has emanated from their respective thoughts and decisions. One is comfortable with the little they earn for survival while the other is determined to soar high since there is no growth in comfort. There is more to life than just a mere survival. Decisions make men, indeed.

In thoughts,deeds and actions life serves as a habitat for all humanity but make a decision about how far you want to go.You can not reach a destination your thoughts have not been. In reality,many are comfortably in a rat race down here just for survival while there are untapped awaiting opportunities up there. Others are in unhealthy competition for survival. Fellows,a progress in discomfort is better than being standstill in comfort. In the face of challenges, challenge yourself to rise like a weed amidst flowers. Decisions make men. In your insatiable quest for job positions and entitlements for survival,do not bite the bait. Some disingenuously offer you opportunities to halt your prospects for greatness. When crowded by intended negative criticisms, never change who you are in the inside, outside. You may not come from a rich background but do not let your background relegate you to the background. Turn and tame all unfavorable circumstances to your favor.
Don't allow people to use you for their parochial interests as a ladder for higher heights in the name of opportunities. Be always on your guard and yet be relaxed. Always be sure of your reasons behind the actions you take.

You have all that you need in YOU. Do not settle for less.
