In this article we'll answer; 1. why you should avoid generic
descriptions of your target audience. 2. what's a good way to define your
target audience. 3. and how does this help out to stand out from your
competition.

**Soccer moms**. **Teens**. **Yuppies**. You might hear businesses use labels like these when they talk about target audiences. It helps them narrow down their ideal customers into an easy group to market to. It really makes sense in theory. Can a generic target audience like **soccer moms** really help you do the best marketing? Let's find out.

The label **soccer moms** tells you that the target audience is made of women with kids. That's right. But it doesn't tell you how these women feel about their lives and what their hopes and dreams are. Also there's a good chance that many other businesses have **soccer moms** as their target audience. When you think about it, the **soccer moms** label isn't actually a specific (narrow) audience at all. It only tells you that these are women with kids and a lot of companies go after that demographic.

When it comes to target audience, we have to remember that customers are people and not stereotypes. Understanding your customers goes beyond just knowing their sex, age group, social status and the type of job they do. What you really need to know is Why. As in, why they act, think and lead their lives they way they do.

Basically, you need to know your customers as the way you know your closet friend.

Broad stereotypes are really easy to come up with. But the reason you shouldn't market to those labels is that it's difficult to be everything to everyone. There are too many competitors out there and to be able to really distinguish yourself, you need to narrow down your target audience. And stereotypes can lead you to assume your target audience is one group when it's actually a completely different group altogether. How do you avoid broad stereotype trap?

> it's difficult to be everything to everyone.

First think about the major assumptions you've made about your customers.

Then challenge those assumptions. Ask yourself which of these assumptions need to be validated before they can become a truth.

Also list out anything you might not know about your customers that you can explore.

As you gradually knife away at stereotypes, there are some good moves and bad moves you need to keep in mind that will help you find a better target audience.

### Target audience good moves

- _Defining them narrowly:_ find the nitty gritty details of your audience.
- _Thinking like them:_ see the world and your business through their eyes.
- _Going deep:_ paying attention to context, mindsets, emotions, motivations and desires.
- _Doing further research:_ look into your theories and assumptions, and back them with data.

### Target audience bad moves

- _Being generic:_ avoid stereotypes rather look for what makes your audience unique.
- _Relying only on generic labels:_ gender, age, race, and other labels won't help you reach narrow definitions.
- _Marketing to everyone:_ the entire world is not an easy target audience to reach.
- _Following your competitors:_ your target audience is entirely different from your competitors.

What those moves are really saying is, look at your audience as three-dimensional. You'll find a lot of ways to do this. But let's take a look at a few jumping off points.

First, you can look at definitions that are normally considered broad and generic, and then begin whittling them down and refining them. Instead of the very large 18 to 49 year old age group, you can look at specific age ranges like early 20's or early 30's or late 40's.

Along with age, you can look at where your target audience is: city, town, rural, urban, another country, continental, etc.

Thirdly, what education level does your target audience have? High school, Bachelor's, Master's or self-educated?

Finally, you can also look at what job type they have: professional, blue collar, business owner, etc

These descriptions do a decent job of defining your audience narrowly, but you can go further by looking at lifestyles and emotions too. Look at what they like to do and what type of hobbies they have. Are they into arts, science, socializing, etc?

You target audience's value can also be a good indicator to tell a lot about them. Research on what they believe in: honesty, hard work, community, family, etc.

Also look at how they view your business and product. Do they think of your business as a pastime, an escape or something else?

Let's now look at a starter framework for your target audience

### Your target audience starter framework

To start defining your target audience, think of one current customer who you really value. Then ask yourself some questions about that person. Questions like these will help:

- What does your customer do for a living?
- Why do they do this job, AKA what motivates them for the job?
- How do they usually feel on a normal workday?
- If they had more free time, what would they do?
- What would they say your product or service does for them?

To conclude, with these questions and other points raised earlier, you have a good framework that will help you to be more specific towards your audience.
