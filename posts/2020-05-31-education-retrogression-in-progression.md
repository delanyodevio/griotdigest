Education in simple terms that seeks to unearth and polish our hidden potentials has been misconstrued to the detriment of its positive impacts on human life. Education in Ghana was mainly informal, and based on apprenticeship before the arrival of European settlers, who introduced a formal education system addressed to the elites. In missionary education, character training was not left out. Many people in Ghana use the word "education" to refer to formal instruction in an European-type school.

Far back in the archives of history, education proved to develop the total being of an individual. Education was premised on cognitive, affective and psychomotor development of all human race. In result, the indelible positive impacts of education in the olden days has been well appreciated.

Suddenly and sadly, the pressing needs of civilization and modernity coupled with individual interests of society have created an erroneous impression about education. This deep-rooted impression is gradually feeding deep into the fibres of the modern society. The modern educational system and society cannot resist but succumb to the fragile impacts of the ill-perceived education; schooling. In our feeble attempts to meet the standards forcibly inherited, we tend to completely copy blindly the incomprehensible practices of "our masters" irrespective of differences in our structures in all aspects. Must the blame be put on the current generation entirely? No! What do you think?

From time immemorial, the past and present governments have done enough to thwart the negative implications of the modern education on the teeming human population. Educational facilities at all levels of the country's education system are woefully inadequate. The available but dilapidated structures are ill-resourced per international standards. Many basic schools across the length and breath of the country do not have convenient and serene environment for teaching and learning talkless to boast of these facilities being furnished with textbooks, technology tools, laboratories, washrooms and the like. It's no more a news that both public and private secondary and tertiary institutions lament over congested facilities for survival. The crude methods of researches done at these institutions also lend credence to this assertion.

It's a fact indisputable that, you can steal a drum but you cannot hide to play it. Fundamentally, resultant effect of education is to address individual and societal needs. The outcome of the current education system proves the otherwise. Can this be attributed to the academic courses being rolled out at all levels of our education system? Yes! The subjects and courses studied across all levels are mainly geared towards the cognitive development of an individual with little to do with practicalities. Even if some have studied practical courses, do they have the required environment to do so? Many studied courses with the main aim of seeking white -collar jobs yet the government cannot absorb all individuals in the public sector. After school, a little proportion of graduates have the requisite skills to establish businesses and themselves to cushion the burden on the government. The larger population now embark on the journey of seeking non-existing jobs. Can't the courses be reviewed to make the human resources more independent after education?

Moreover, the managerial composition and government interference cannot be exonerated. Political affiliations cloud the decision making of these individuals at the helms of affairs. Many educational institutions have the management bodies well filled with persons of political affiliations over competencies. Other educational institutions have also witnessed some forms of instabilities due to "invisible hands" in their daily administrations. These education institutions tend to make policies to favor their political "backbones" at the expense of the student population. The academic calendar of some institutions are occasionally disrupted due to tension borne out of disagreements in the various institutions. The students are rather left at the mercy of the authorities to comprehend anything made available to them after paying fatty fees. The students leadership too is being taken by potential politicians who only fuel the agenda of their pay masters. The conscious efforts of other stakeholders to make educational institutions more independent of government and political interference proved futile overtime thereby churning out graduates with "no education".

Consequentially, it is evidentially clear that we have much to do to put our education system on the best of footings. In this Covid-19 pandemic era, many advanced countries with sophisticated educational systems have devised ways to provide tuition to all students across all levels. In our efforts to do same, we have been met with numerous challenges because our system is an alien to the aforementioned measure. Wouldn't it be much easier if internet connections with technology tools were made available on campuses from basic to tertiary educational facilities. Standardized education system allows all individuals to meet the demands of the international market.

Education forms the basis of every positive growth in individual and society. If it must be pursued, it must be done well to produce "assets" rather than "liabilities".
