Being a father is a privilege. Being able to father a wise and a righteous child is a title and takes energy. In this story we'll look at five sure ways a father can radiate love to the family.

### 1. Being the source of joy and happiness to the family.

The goal of life is happiness, and to be able to feel joy in all our circumstances. The most worthwhile thing from a father is to be the source of happiness, and create a joyous environment for the family.

Happiness is sharable. The first source of happiness to the family is the father, because the father is basically the head of the family.

### 2. keeping your child's best interest at heart.

You want what is best for your child, with no extrinsic motive. Because of that, you always try to provide unbiased support and advice.

You need to know when to rebuke, when to give advice, and how to be supportive. A father's advice and support is needed for the child to be able to handle issues even at your back. This also helps the child to feel love from the family.

### 3. Supporting your child's dreams.

Children have big dreams. Being able to understand and provide support to your child's needs and dreams is essentially vital to the child's development.

### 4. Spending quality and quantity time with your family.

One of the things as a father you need to check is to be able to balance work and family. You want to spent as much quality time with your love ones and you also want to work in order to provide basic stuffs for the family.

Your care and love radiates when you're able to spent much quality time with your family. Let it count, every second.

### 5. Having understanding and communicative heart.

Your family members are humans. Being able to comprehend how and why they behave is vital to a happier family life.

As a father, you have to be able to communicate the family values and principles in a very clear tone to other members.

To conclude, a father is the first CEO of life. A father's leadership, love and care are what make a family. Take quality care of your family. Radiates your love to the family. And shape the family the way you lead your life.
