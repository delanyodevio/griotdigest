As humans, one of the situations in which we often finds ourselves as being weak and powerless is during sleep. If you’re part of the almighty nocturnal group that subscribe to the saying “Sleep is for the weak” or “Sleep is a trap”, you might want to reconsider this ascertion and succumb to quality sleep and good sleeping habits.

Ever woken up in the middle of your sleep only to realize you can’t move, speak or scream? I bet you’ve been taken by fear, fear of dying or being dead?? Yes, that’s more like it! However, the most interesting and scary part in this situation is that, you will find yourself struggling with all your might just to move or wake up and sometimes, you feel being choked (like something is sitting on you) but none of your efforts works. This is how being weak and powerless really feels like!

Now that you’ve gotten the idea of this mysterious situation that renders us weak and powerless, what do you think is behind this? Well, as humans as we are, we have several beliefs so it’s uncommon not to associate this happening to some spiritual powers playing tricks on us in our sleeps. Unfortunately, this isn’t the reality (at least, not in every case). This situation actually is a very popular happening in about 40% of the human population and it’s known as Sleep Paralysis or Temporal Paralysis.

What Is Sleep Paralysis?

It is a state, during waking up or falling asleep, in which a person is aware but unable to move or speak. During an episode, one may hallucinate (hear, feel, or see things that are not there), which often results in fear. Episodes generally last less than a couple of minutes. It may occur as a single episode or be recurrent.

Research on this subject led to a conclusion that, in most cases, sleep paralysis is simply a sign that your body is not moving smoothly through the stages of sleep. Rarely is sleep paralysis linked to deep underlying psychiatric problems. In fact, we find ourselves unable to move or scream because during such occasions, our muscles goes into hibernation(turned off temporarily) to make way for our body to fully relax and replenish cells and tissues.

Over the centuries, symptoms of sleep paralysis have been described in many ways and often attributed to an "evil" presence: unseen night demons in ancient times and alien abductors. Almost every culture throughout history has had stories of shadowy evil creatures that terrify helpless humans at night. People have long sought explanations for this mysterious sleep-time paralysis and the accompanying feelings of terror hence the findings. Several circumstances have been identified that are associated with an increased risk of sleep paralysis. These include insomnia, sleep deprivation, an erratic sleep schedule, stress, and physical fatigue. There are two types of Sleep Paralysis namely hypnagogic and hypnopompic. The former occurs when we’re about sleeping and the later occurs during sleep. The common one being the hypnopompic hence the main focal point of this article.

What Happens With Hypnagogic Sleep Paralysis?

As you fall asleep, your body slowly relaxes. Usually you become less aware, so you do not notice the change. However, if you remain or become aware while falling asleep, you may notice that you cannot move or speak.

What Happens With Hypnopompic Sleep Paralysis?

During sleep, your body alternates between REM (rapid eye movement) and NREM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep. One cycle of REM and NREM sleep lasts about 90 minutes. NREM sleep occurs first and takes up to 75% of your overall sleep time. During NREM sleep, your body relaxes and restores itself. At the end of NREM, your sleep shifts to REM. Your eyes move quickly and dreams occur, but the rest of your body remains very relaxed. Your muscles are "turned off" during REM sleep. If you become aware before the REM cycle has finished, you may notice that you cannot move or speak.
