Learning how to learn has been identified as one of the most required
skills for the future of work. Learning faster than others is the ultimate,
lasting competitive advantage. The single most important skill for
self-development is the ability to expand your knowledge base.

At no stage of life one have to stop learning. But have you ever wondered what’s the fastest, most effective way to learn? What’s the secret to remembering what you learn?

When it comes to learning how to learn, these are the pressing questions. If you have a better answer to them, you will be more successful.

> Knowledge has to be improved, challenged, and increased constantly, or it vanishes." — Dr. Peter Drucker

As time has passed, a few models have proven particularly life-changing and have now become the pillars of learning. These pillars have been explored by one of the thought leaders in this field. I will provide links to them.

Basically we have five pillars and [Michael Simmons](https://twitter.com/michaeldsimmons) gave thorough explanations on all of them. In his own words, these include:

1. [Collecting the most useful, universal, and timeless mental models in the world to build a base of rare and valuable knowledge that is instantly practical, applies across domains, will never expire, and that will compound.](https://medium.com/accelerated-intelligence/how-to-tell-if-someone-is-truly-smart-or-just-average-a2f0bcac5db2)

2. [Using the 5-Hour Rule to set aside a minimum of 5 hours per week for deliberate learning.](https://medium.com/accelerated-intelligence/bill-gates-warren-buffett-and-oprah-all-use-the-5-hour-rule-308f528b6363)

5. [Teach what you learn — as soon as you learn it.](https://medium.com/accelerated-intelligence/memory-learning-breakthrough-it-turns-out-that-the-ancients-were-right-7bbd3090d9cc)

In this article, I will also share my thoughts on the fith pillar. Particularly I will touch on the areas: how teaching benefits us in learning, and the various ways we can leverage on this pillar to quickly advance through the learning phases, which is called, the learning loop.

First, let's look at the learning loop.

### The Learning Loop.

The traditional way of learning has been about just taking in information. Either through a lecture or reading from a book. But what most people don't know is that there's a system for processing information.

> Looking at text and expecting to learn is not far off from looking at food and expecting to get its nutrients. We need to digest our life experiences just like we digest our food. Without some form of active processing, almost everything we read is lost within weeks." — Michael Simmons

According to Michael Simmons, there are four stages to this process: the absorption stage, the transformation stage, the experimentation stage and the feedback stage.

When we read a piece of article, watch a lecture, or have a life experience, we are basically absorbing the information. But we can transformed it in the brain to make it understandable and usable. Then through actions and experimentations we can get necessary results which will be the feedback that will helps us improve on the whole learning process.

Amazingly, teaching is the single most effective activity that works in all the four stages. Let's see why.

### How teaching helps you learn faster and effectively.

> The Big Idea: Teaching Is One Of The Most Important DAILY Habits We Should ALL Cultivate — Michael Simmons

The truth is, teaching isn't just for teachers. We are all teachers at some level. Teaching others what we have learned is one of the noblest things we can do at no cost with our short time on earth.

When we intentionally share the insights with others and they find it genuinely useful, we create a bliss of senergy. We get something back and we give something out.

For instance, through teaching, you're inherently performing transformation on your previous absorbed knowledge. This helps you to get a deeper understanding on the knowledge.

In teaching what you learn especially as early as you learn it, magical things happen before, during and after. These include:

- By teaching yourself (either reading out loud or talking to yourself), you're basically deepening your understanding level on the subject.

- Folks that prepare to deliver lessons or presentations often experience discoveries. When you learn with the intention to teach, you learn more deeply.

- By discussing and explaining something with your friends, you're not just strengthening your relationship, all of you are actually learning.

- When you give knowledge away, not only do you also keep it, it actually grows stronger in your mind. Just as you plant a seed to grow it up.

- During explanation hours, you'll often identify the necessary gaps in your knowledge.

- Teaching helps you derives underlying principles from your daily life. That mean, you don't just teach the information, but also your experience.

- Teaching is actually a leverage for learning. We can spend years learning a concept and yet transfer it to someone else in minutes.

- Teaching gives you valuable feedback from others and it makes you accountable to apply what you learn.

- Teaching too is becoming one of the most lucrative professions. We are now having coaches, managers, thought leaders, mentors, authors, teachers, advisors, journalists, facilitators, consultants, and bloggers, just to name a few. And the demand for those classes of people are going high every single day especially due to the help of the internet.

We all can and should make it as part of daily lives to always intentionally teach not just ourselves but others what we learned. We may be teaching when we:

- Talk to ourselves during learning periods.

- Have conversation with others.

- Explain important life lessons to our kids or siblings.

- Share what we learned on social media platforms. Yes share it. And I'll come back to this point.

- Participate in a teamwork. Or being part of clup or mastermind group.

- Share your work, profession, thought process or whatever you do on blogs.

> “When one teaches, two learn.” — Robert Heinlein

Now that we have seen the benefits we get from teaching, let's dive into how we can effectively use it as a way of learning.

### Putting it into action: the explanation effect.

To get more learning from teaching, we need to look at the explanation effect; which can be broken into two types:

1. **Internal explanation effect;** this is where we explain a concepts to ourselves. We can do that through journaling, [mind mapping](https://www.google.com/search?q=mind-mapping&oq=mind-mapping), thinking out loud, talking to yourself while doing an activity (I often do this while coding), etc.

2. **External explanation effect;** this is where we’re teaching one or more individuals informally (eg, conversations, masterminding, teamwork, group talks, etc) or professionally (coaching, consulting, writing, etc).

The Explanation Effect helps you think about a whole range of actions you can take to become a better learner.

As you gradually refine the knowledge in your head, you learn it more deeply until it becomes something you remember forever, apply automatically, and get great results within your own life. As you move from internal to external, your lessons help other people — not just yourself.

It is easier than ever to get most of your income by teaching others as a coach, manager, thought leader, therapist, teacher, facilitator, mentor, investor, advisor, speaker, writer, author, blogger or consultant. Because as the quality of your knowledge and teaching improves, you can charge people or even take equity in a company if you advise a startup.

Let's look at how we can implement all these in our daily life.

### The "Today I learned journal"

The supper simple way to to get started with the habit of teaching is by creating a daily “Today I Learned” email journal. Near the end of your day, spend 15 minutes writing down [One Thing](https://www.griotstudio.com/motivation/productivity/2020/07/build-your-resilience-in-tough-times-with-these-three-intentional-strategies) you learned during the day.

There are two versions to this. Which is, you can either just keep it for yourself or share it with others and invite them to share what they learned with you:

1. **Single player:** Write an email and send it to yourself, or just write it in a journal. If you want to go a step further, you can also ask yourself, “How can I turn this insight into action in my life?”

2. **Multiplayer:** Write down your lesson learned in some form of social media (email, Slack, Facebook, Medium, Instagram) and then share it with others.

Others ways of doing this at scale are:

- Creating content (books, podcasts, blogs).

- Participating in mastermind groups or teamwork.

- Turning your job into a platform to learn and teach. Most companies are now having in house blogs that help share the company's values and identities.

The benefits are enormous. With the “Today I Learned” journal, you:

- **Learn faster and effectively:** this is where you cement the valuable pieces of knowledge by reflection and teaching someone else.

- **Build deeper and cleaner relationships:** by sharing what you learned with others, we stay connected, and help others to grow in their own life.

- **Become better at teaching others:** through feedback, you get to improve your teaching ability.

- **Keeping record of your learnings so you can reflect on them later:** as you return to your daily lessons again over the years, you’ll notice how your answers change for the better.

### The Griot Learning Tribe

To put this into a perspective we pioneered and created a Facebook private group called [Griot Learning Tribe](https://www.facebook.com/groups/191324675632785) to help others start this habbit too. Here's how it works....

1. Share your lessons and stories learned at least once a week

2. Tagging your posts by topics. This way, you and other members can read lessons by the topics you’re most interested in.

3. Read and comment on other people's lessons so you can learn, but also you can discover similar spirits.

And much more! If you're interested you can strait away join the group and start sharing, teaching as you learn too.
