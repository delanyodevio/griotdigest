No one can follow it down through the ages without realizing that the whole purpose of existence is GROWTH. Life is dynamic. Not static. It is ever moving forward. Not standing still. The one unpardonable sin of nature is to stand still, to stagnate.

All the giants monsters of prehistoric ages are gone. They ceased to serve a single useful purpose. They did not know how to meet the changing conditions. They stood still. Stagnated while the life around them passed them by.

The evidence of this growth is all around us. Take up some form of violent exercise - swimming, riding through the mountains, running a marathon. In the few days your muscles are weak, easily tired. But keep on for a week, a month, a year. The growth factor promptly strengthens them (your muscles), toughens them, to meet their new demands.

Now do some manual rough labor and what happens? The skin of your hands becomes tender, blisters and hurts. But keep it up, and does the skin all wear off? On the contrary, the growth factor provides extra thickness, extra toughness, calluses. We call them - "to meet the demand".

> Life is boring, until problem comes.

### To meet the demands: four major ways to keep growing

1. Always be around with people that are higher and better than you. You can do this either by listening to them, reading from them or following them.
2. Curate your principles and advices from people that have gotten to where you want to go, and have achieved what you want to achieve.
3. Aks questions to know the principles and processes they passed through so you can have a proper guidepost
4. Always take action on everything you learn. Feel free to make mistakes. Give room for improvements. And get messy with your ideas.

All through your daily life you will find this growth factor steadily at work. Embrace it, work with it, take it to yourself and there is nothing you cannot do. The mere fact that you have obstacles to overcome is in your favor, for when there is nothing be done, when things run along too smoothly; this growth factor seems to sleep. It is when you need it, when you call upon it urgently, that it is most on the job.

With these four major growth factor, to your greatness.
