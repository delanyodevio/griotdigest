Acquiring a home is as desirable as it is a necessity to navigate life comfortably and relatively stress-free. Acquiring a home immediately however is often beyond most people’s financial ability. This means acquiring a home for many remains just but a dream. However, this doesn’t have to be, so long as mortgages exist! Mortgages are simply loans you take to finance landed properties.

In developed countries, Mortgage is the main means by which, middle class workers own homes. The narrative however, is different for Africa. For example: Owning a landed property in Accra (Ghana) is not a thing for the average salaried worker these days due to the astronomical costs of real estate in recent times. This means such workers have to be in rented rooms and apartments throughout their active working years while trying to save money and acquire a land on which they hope to build. It has even become a norm for Government workers to build using their retirement benefits (SSNIT contributions) after going out of service. Even this, not so many are able to do it in the cities as they’ll rather do it in their hometowns where it’s more affordable (cost of land and building is lesser in the villages). Under normal circumstances, such people would have loved to live in the cities where they’ve worked their entire life but they’re forced to move back to their root.

Why should a young salaried worker have to save his/her entire working life just to be able to acquire a decent home with some household installations and appliances?? With the rate of inflation in the economy, cost of land and building materials keeps on increasing astronomically year on year. This means it’s more expensive to wait for the “right time” before owning a real estate as every year one waits adds at least 20% to the initial cost of such a venture.

This means if one needs GH¢100,000 to build a two-bedroom house and the person can only save this amount in 30 years time from now, by the time he/she gets that amount (in 30 years time), the cost of same house would have been 10 times more! How can that person afford such a house again when average service year in Ghana is around 35 years?? Also, there are those who will take loans to acquire land and begin developing it at their own pace(as and when money comes) but this also comes with extra costs as it’ll take longer than necessary for such a project to be completed and ready for inhabitation. Those who choose this method eventually don’t get to enjoy the benefits of their sweats before death takes them away. Some are not even able to finish before dying. Others too may lose their jobs(source of income) along the way hence unable to continue the project. In all these, one would then ask: What’s the way forward? Well, I’d say the way forward is Mortgage!

A mortgage is a special form of secured loan where the purpose of the loan ( to purchase unmovable property such as a house or piece of land), is specified to the lender(the institution giving out the money) by the borrower. The assets are registered as the legal property of the borrower(the worker) but the lender can seize them and dispose of them if they are not satisfied with the manner in which the repayment of the loan is conducted by the borrower(when the worker is not meeting the payment schedules as agreed on in the contract). Once the loan is fully repaid, the lender loses this right of seizure and the assets are then deemed to be unencumbered(without any more outstanding commitments). Thus, the property finally becomes his/hers!

Why is this the way to go?

The concept behind Mortgaging is to allow people to start enjoying what they’ve been hoping to enjoy in future should they continue working and saving towards owning such a property that will give them that kind of life. Thus, young couples who are working and plan to be setting aside some money for a house in 30 years time, can start living in that house now and be paying for it as they’ll do, the intended savings. What a better and comfortable way to begin life?

Although it’s likely to lose your mortgage on the property should you suffer an income loss that makes you unable to continue paying up, it’s not a risky venture in itself as there are ways to protect oneself against certain income losses such as opting for an insurance cover for the assets that generates income for you. Now, to the important aspect; are there Mortgage institution’s in Ghana? If yes, why are people not patronizing their services considering the comfort it brings?

Mortgage Loan Providers in Ghana:

In Ghana, a number of structures – in the form of banks and other financial institutions – exist to help you secure a loan to build or buy the home of your dreams. Below are a list of the few Mortgage institutions we have in Ghana.

• GHL Bank

• Republic Bank

• Stanbic Bank

• Fidelity Bank

• Societe Generale Ghana

• Omni Bank

• Bond Financial Services

• Dalex Finance Leasing Co. Ltd

Also, there are Real Estate developers that provides homes on Mortgage basis for interested clients. Clients initially pay about 20% of the cost of the property and move in while the rest of the cost is spread across several years

Examples:

• Omicron Estates Services

• Westfields Real Estates

• DCI Microfinance Limited - Head Office

• Ghana Prime Properties

• Imperial Homes Limited

• Regimanuel Grey Estates

• GoldKey Properties

One would argue that, it’s more cost effective and safer to build one’s own home but really, are you doing this for your own benefit as well as posterity or just posterity?? For me, I prefer to enjoy part of my labour at the stage of my life that I needed it most. What about you?? Why dream of a retirement home when you can start enjoying now into retirement??
