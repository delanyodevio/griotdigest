summary: Marriage is a lifetime journey to an unknown destination. A journey
  that no one knows how it will end. I believe the marriage certificate is
  issued before the marriage life begins unlike in normal academic field. This i
  presume is because you will be your own teacher, guide, etc, you're your own
  marking scheme. So there will be no one with you to access you. Therefore all
  decisions are in your hands and it's assumed you're already a winner🏆 .

Marriage and wedding are two different things, one is real and the other is a mirage. Over the years Ghanaian marriage ceremonies have been infused with expensive weddings. Don't get me wrong, am not against expensive weddings. Am against forcing expensive weddings just to please people. Weddings these days are the new trends, without it you may be considered selfish, poor or out of touch with the modern world.

I've heard of people draining their savings or taking loans to organize weddings. And am like **holy cow !**

> Why drink poison just to cure a common headache

**_Out of greed some people are swallowing things that are bigger than their throat._** Marriage is a long journey that no one knows how it will end so why empty your pocket now just to feed and show off to some 300 guest that you don't even know. If you take a loan for your wedding, when will you finish paying and also invest?It's good to copy but why copy blindly? If you're rich or can afford an expensive wedding without over stressing your budget, why not. But trying to live up to the expectations of others is so wrong. Why live in a rented single room or chamber and hall but use Gh10,000 or more on a ceremony? That money is enough to build a house in my town.

I understand some ladies impose it on their fiances to have such extravagant weddings as a sign of love as well as some families. That's crazy wickedness and immaturity. So after a wedding ceremony what next? What to eat, wear, bills, etc will still be staring at you. What if after your wedding, your partner loses his or her job, got seriously ill or even involved in an accident. What will be your anchor ⚓? For the ladies, it's a special day and it must be memorable but that doesn't mean at the cost of your future life and happiness. Your future security should be the topmost priority. Most newly weds have huge fights and problems just after marriage all because of **money**. Others use the whole of their honeymoon just to fight, after they've started counting their losses.

I think covid 19 has shown us how self enslaved we've been all along. I never knew Ghanaians could have maximum of 25 people as wedding attendants. And we've seen how cost saving it is. We now know that it's

cool even if you decide to have 5 people at the ceremony. Stop killing yourselves trying to please people who will still complain about the food. Don't imprison yourselves in debt all because of wedding, do not become broke just after your wedding, it's not worth it.

If indeed you're ready for marriage, Gh1,000 and 10 people in attendance is more than enough to get you a wedding ceremony. But if you're not serious about marrying your partner, you will be waiting to get that Gh20,000 and 300 guests.
