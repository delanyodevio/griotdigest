The internet is fast growing and has become a big platform for quick, easy and consistent money making. Talking about making money over the internet, there are two categories to this. The first is the genuine way where you provide a service over the internet and get paid for it. The second is the fraudulent way where you find dubious means of making money over the internet from unsuspecting victims or by false pretenses.

This brings me to the main area of focus for this article; defrauding by false pretenses. The motivation behind this article? A friend of mine sent me such a “venture” in the bid to refer me to sign up and partake in the offer at absolute no cost!

What kind of scam am I talking about?

It’s the kind that offers you the “opportunity” to “work from home” using just your phone or PC without the need to invest anything like money into it. All you need is your device, internet access and time! Sounds cool right? Looks like what most of us youths in Africa needs right? Yes, this is the kind of thing we need since there are barely any job or capital to setup something for ourselves.

As a result, some unscrupulous people have been taking advantage of this our desperation for “free money” to tailor to us, what we would literally kill to have – a stress-free money making avenue at no cost!

What’s the weak-link to falling for this scam?

1. Sheer desperation
2. Tech-illiteracy
3. Gullibility
4. Ignorance
5. Peer Pressure
6. Curiosity

For the purposes of this article, I’ll be addressing only the Tech-illiteracy aspect since the other factors are just personal resolves.

The Nature of this Scam:

There will be website that entreats its visitors to sign up and take part in some specially designed tasks on daily basis with the promise of giving them earnings for each completed task.

This means you’ll have to be accessing the website everyday and doing the assigned task(s). Whenever the task is complete, you’ll be credited with your earnings in your virtual account on the website.

They’ll give you a minimum earning threshold that can qualify you to be able to request for withdrawal and also a time frame for which the withdrawal request can go through.

More importantly, there’ll be a column on the homepage where you’ll be shown a bunch list of “accounts” of “users” and the amounts they’ve requested to withdraw as well as the “status” of their requests – paid out or in process.

This is all it takes – a cheap website, a task (forex trading, viewing paid advertisements, etc) and list of payouts

### What actually happens:

Assuming the timeframe for “cashing out” is one month and you’ve done the tasks with dedication and met the minimum threshold for withdrawal. You then request for withdrawal – via PayPal, Bitcoin, WorldRemit, Wave or Western Union.

You’ll then see your transaction with the status “Processing” or “In Process”. At this point, you’ll be waiting eagerly or patiently for the payout. While waiting, you may continue the earning cycle or wait for the first payout to ascertain the authenticity of the “business”.

Well, unfortunately, you’ll be waiting to eternity! The money will never hit your account because there’s really no money! You were just being used for internet traffic purposes for the website owner’s sole benefit. This sounds awfully ill, right? Sorry, that’s just how the world works during desperate times – either you eat or get eaten!

Wondering how they’ll continue to be in business? That’s the simplest part. Whenever the “customer base” of the business goes down due to earlier victims backing out because of non-payment, they simply close the first website and open another one. The business is new again and new set of victims will be targeted.

Warning Signs:

• A job advertisement that claims no skills or experience are required.

• It offers high pay for little or no work.

• A company promises that a business opportunity is surefire and will pay off quickly and easily.

• You're required to pay upfront for training, certifications, directories or materials.

### How not to fall a victim??

1. Accept that there’s no “free money” online for the daft or Tech-illiterate
2. Don’t succumb to peer pressure to sign up for such scams via referral links
3. Critically analyze such avenues and take your time at it to follow their operations.
4. Don’t believe website testimonials. People are paid to do this.
5. Have it in your mind that, there’s no reasonable earnings without parting with real resources.
6. Don’t stick around if there’s any suggestion that your earnings are based primarily on recruiting other people to join the operation — it’s probably a pyramid scheme.
7. Always remember the quote “if it’s too good to be true, then it’s probably false”. Miracles don’t happen online.

There are legitimate jobs one can do online. However, these jobs require a skill and a person(s) interested in buying that skill over the internet. This is just how it works. Not every skill can be sold online!

I’ll end here for now. Do you

have any of such online offers you’ll like to check out if they’re genuine? Let me know about ii in the comments section. Be rest assured I’ll help you with the digital autopsy of their platform. Be a responsible person. Before you go about recommending any recently chanced upon online “business opportunities” to your friends and family, at least make sure you’ve made your first “cash out”! Don’t look stupid and gullible in the face of your friends and families. Be realistic, Stop the greed, Be safe!

Knowledge is power indeed!
