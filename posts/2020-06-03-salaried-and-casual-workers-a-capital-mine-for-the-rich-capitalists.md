Capitalism is an economic system where a small percentage of the
population owns majority of the wealth, power and resources. This system
survives on conflict, inequality and false hope from the working class, who
are set up to believe that they can achieve a capitalist lifestyle.
Unfortunately, the working class is only a tool and a source of funding for
the rich Capitalists. This, has to change as Capitalism does more harm than
good to a nation.

In Ghana, most salaried and casual workers have been struggling financially such that, one tends to wonder what exactly is responsible for such a phenomenon. After working hard throughout their life, one retires on pensions and savings. This has been the norm for most people because we’ve been taught that, savings and investment is the sure way out of poverty. Unfortunately, most workers tend to lose sight of the investment aspect and only focus on the savings. Thus, to be rich in future, most people subscribe to the savings culture.

However, extensive savings culture breeds and fuels capitalism which is not good for our economy. Capitalism is an economic system where a small percentage of the population owns majority of the wealth, power and resources. This system survives on conflict, inequality and false hope from the working class, who are set up to believe that they can achieve a capitalist lifestyle.

Due to the extreme savings culture being adopted by the working class with the belief and hope that it’s the way to achieving capitalist lifestyle, our Capitalists who are always hungry for avenues to explore, devised several platforms via which, they can pool the funds of these workers to enhance their activities in wealth creation. Honestly, it’s not their fault owners of the funds don’t know what to do with it. Thus, wealth creation is reserved for those who have the ideas and the “balls” to execute it. The effects of capitalism becomes worst when these Capitalists repatriate the funds abroad to invest in other economies thereby deepening the woes of the people by starving them of jobs.

Classifications of Capitalists:

There are two classifications of Capitalists (based on how they take the monies from the working class).

• First are those that create their own financial institutions such as Banks, Insurance Schemes, Investment Companies, Hedge Funds Management, Micro Finance, “Susu” Collection company, Pension Schemes, etc.

• Second are those that seize all the extra funds in the financial markets in the area of loans. (They’re the ones who are always granted loans at the detriment of workers who also needed same funds)

The First Class of Capitalists:

Banks—A Capitalist who needs huge funds for his businesses (usually a conglomerate), only needs to gather the small funds he has and use it to open a bank. When workers who don’t have any short-term plans for their monies bring these monies to the bank for savings, they literally give the money out to someone or group of people to use as deemed fit. The only condition is to make the funds available upon demand which is literally no problem at all since people will always bring in money for savings. All that is needed to get access to the money for their own use or benefit is through strategic advancement of loans. Trust me, these people have several ways to get it done without breaking a sweat hence they eventually allocate the monies to themselves as loans and also to fund businesses they have interest in at the blind side of the Regulatory Body—Bank of Ghana. The incidents that led to the recent banking sector clean up is evident enough to appreciate the extent to such a rot.

Insurance Institutions—Another “harmless” and “unsuspecting” area is Insurance. The part of their services in focus here are those that are of investment/wealth creation nature. These services has been added to their traditional operations because of the unfortunate common knowledge that, a lot of workers have excess monies, monies they have no short-term plan for. So they convince such people to be putting aside some fixed amount with them on regular basis (monthly) for some specified term( 4 or 5 years minimum) in exchange for an interest on the money at the end of the period. A good number of the people who subscribes to these offers often lose good sums of their investment due to “technicalities”. Ever wonder why the insurance industry is the most profitable in the Services Sector of the economy?? Simple answer: They often don’t pay claims, even when they do, it’s nothing compared to what they get as cashflows per month. More so, they are always accumulating free monies from those who breach their agreements(clients forfeit parts or all of their monies when they couldn’t live up to their commitments or when they decide to quit too soon).

Investment Companies—As for Investment Companies, they’re part of what I would term, a necessary evil. Their modus operandi is to promise unrealistic returns within short periods to lure the people into investing with them. Unfortunately, as most of these companies don’t have good management, they tend to do bad investments themselves and lose part or all of depositors money. Eventually, the company folds up, leaving the depositors with nothing. At the end, the depositors will be blamed although there are regulatory bodies in the country that are tasked to be monitoring and regulating the operations of such entities. The Government forgets that, not everybody have the knowledge and financial analytic skills to vet such businesses and schemes before making their decisions. After all, the companies have been licensed to operate.

Others—Last on this list are the Hedge Fund Management Companies, the Microfinance Institutions, the “Susu” collection entities, all follow similar footsteps of the “big players”. As salaried and casual workers, no matter the amounts we can spare monthly, there’s always a business such an amount can support. We can’t continue working forever, at a point, we’ll need a residual income to fall back on in times of necessity. Sadly, everyone desires a degree of financial freedom but most of us either don’t have the balls to venture into a money-making business or have “enough” capital to execute it nor have the idea as to what to do with the little we have. These has given the opportunity for the rich to continue riding on the backs of the hardworking people and enriching themselves more. So long as we continue to save up and sign onto these less profitable schemes (less profitable in real terms) designed by the rich to impoverish it’s victims (customers), the working class will always be a Mine for the rich to be extracting.

The Second Class of Capitalists:

These are those that are at the top in the Loans market. Since they have thriving businesses and a lot of landed properties and financial Instruments, they always top the list when it comes to granting of loans. The poor workers send their monies to the banks, the banks gather the monies and give it to the Rich Capitalists to use to further expand their businesses and to service their expenditures. The casual workers who saves with the banks don’t have properties that can be used as collateral for loans hence are not able to get loan when they need it. This is how bad the system has been. Money always consciously moving from the less privileged to the privileged yet the less privileged always cry foul that only few people are controlling the monies in the country, forgetting they’re the catalysts to this whole phenomenon.

They Way Out?

Let’s have a renewal of mind as to what we do with our extra monies and see how things will turn out for us. Venture into something by yourself today, start small, add more capital as you progress, don’t think too much about the initial profits and prospects. You’ll surely get there. This is how giant businesses start.
