As i lay on my bed with **thoughts** racing through my mind like _formula 1 sports_. there was so much speed like a busy road without _traffic lights_. i thought i was going to crush in my **confusion**. i even thought i was going crazy, because i was restless.

then i took a deep breathe and asked myself; why don't i follow these thoughts and see where it leads to. i then had a little adventure in my head. such a beautiful journey because it made me think wide, see the unseen and very interactive.

that was when i realized i had opened the door to my world of **imagination** (the unseen world). then something whispered in my ears "**_you are your own artist, create what you want"._**

so i reached out for my _canvas board_ **(mind)**, _my colors_ **(minds eye)** and*brushes* **(hands)** to paint and make sketches of my life. then i knew that i am the creator**!** when i think it, i can mold it and create it.

grab your canvas today, create your life because it all starts in your **MIND !**
