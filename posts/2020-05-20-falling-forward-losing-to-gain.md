A loss at a point in life is a blessing in disguise if you command the mental fortitude to turn it into a gain. As we sojourn through the uncertainties of our existence, we vow to sail through toil and joy. Not to betray your vow, ask yourself! If I am going to lose and I am because everyone does, why can't I turn it into a gain?

How do you do that? By learning from it. A loss isn't totally a loss if you learn something as a result of it.

Your losses can come to define you if you let them. You can eventually stuck there if you choose to stay where loss leaves you. But you can choose to change, grow,and learn from your losses.

In times of loss,the most important person you ever talk to is yourself,so be careful what you say. In times of loss,the most important person you will evaluate is yourself,so be careful what you think. In times of loss,the most important person you will love is yourself,so be careful what you do.

Losing really hurts but we learn and gain from it.
