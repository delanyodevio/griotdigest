These days, young people seem to be frustrated when it comes to the
idea of marriage because of how expensive it is.

It is believed that marriage is the official channel through which God uses to continue the creation of human beings. All over the world, marriage is very essential and in Africa, it is a great deal. Marriage is a major link that connects two different families together, so there's so much pride attached to it.

If there is an intimate union between two people without the knowledge or involvement of their families, it is considered disrespectful and i believe it is. Because if someone comes into your home without your permission to take something that is vital, it's just too disrespectful and that's trespassing. Since it took the intimate effort of other couples to bring forth a child, nurture him or her into full being, it's appropriate to seek permission before having a marital union with such a person. And marriage seems like the official permission.

Marriage rites in Africa especially Ghana seems to be dependent on what is called the **list**. This is believed to contain the items needed for the marriage ceremony or rites. It varies from tribe to tribe and family to family. Marriage is expected to be a peaceful one so should the ceremony but some may start on a bitter note due to this _so called list._

This list can bring enmity between the two families due to agitations and disagreements. Some of these lists can be very **outrageous**. Some lists even include **cigarettes**, **match** **sticks**, **phones**, **laptop**, etc.

Come on**!** So can't the family members buy their own cigarettes again?

This has scared some youth (men) away from marriage because they may have to save a lot to buy everything on that list. Why should young couples who should have fun at the beginning of their marriage rather be thinking about debts, bitterness, etc.

In some tribes i understand they exchange **cola nuts**, some **drinks** and **gifts** to show appreciation to the parents and the family. This is simple and cheap. So why should others want to use this list to **reap off** the young men? Shouldn't the families rather be a source of support to these young couples who are venturing into the **unknown world of marriage?** Is this how the custom has been or it was changed by some greedy individuals just to genuinely plant burdens in families?

I thin

k we need to re look at this custom and do the necessary changes. Make it very flexible for young men to perform marriage rites because the youth of today do not like commitment and marriage so why even push them away further. Other places, handshakes are enough as a way of giving permission but over here, we want to use this list to become **rich over night**. The sad aspect of this is that, the very people who will be insisting on every item on this list, are the greedy, wicked, selfish family members who haven't contributed to the growth of the family but they oppose everything.

If we are using this list as a barrier to scare genuine young men from getting married, then they will continue to steal your precious pearls **(daughters)** in your **gardens** without your permission.
