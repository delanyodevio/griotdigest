It is good to copy from others but make sure to decode whatever that
is copied to suit your environment.

The fastest and cheapest way to learn is to observe and copy. This has worked powerfully many times. This method has been deployed by great nations on the Asian continent suck as China, Japan, Korea, etc.

We were colonised by the white man for many years and due to that, we have developed certain roots of connection. Africa gained independence for a very long time and for Ghana, it's been over 63 years now. Even though we have been independent, we don't act as such. And this applies to the whole continent. Our form of education, our governance (democracy), economic activities, were all prescribed by our slave masters. It's like a set of rules or commandments they gave us before leaving.

I didn't know we could have our own way of doing things until the great arrival of covid 19. Covid is a global pandemic but i have realized that every country is handling it differently according to what works for them. In the Asian, European, American countries, etc, the virus behaves differently from the one in Africa. And for a moment i thought we have covid 19 in those countries and covid 18 in Africa. Because most of the symptoms associated with the virus such as fever, shortness of breathe, etc are experienced by a few over here. Most of those who got the virus are asymptomatic. So our approach and medication to dealing with the virus is also different.

We can't have the forever type of lockdown and other forms of restrictions. This is because our economies, housing, work, etc are totally different from those in other continents.

So when i look at this scenario, i asked myself why then haven't we been able to handle our leadership and governance differently from other continents? It is good to copy but make sure what you copy, you transfer it to suit your environment. Asians copied from America but they owned what they copied. They copied things such as democracy, industry, education, agriculture, etc but theirs are totally different. They copied the concept but blend it with their culture, etc. Unlike in Africa, we copy from the leaf to the root forgetting that the idea may behave differently because of our culture and environment.
Our form of education is from chew to pour, democracy is abysmal and rather breeding corruption and greed. Instead of taking the democracy concept to blend with our life here so we can craft our form of it. Industry is a no go area, we're only import driven.
Majority of our minerals are exported in their raw nature.

We feed the world but cannot feed ourselves so we're dying in hunger and poverty. The oil, gold, bauxite, cocoa, etc are feeding the world and the average African cannot even afford a hot cocoa drink not to even talk of chocolate.
We can't produce our own food, we can't set up factories smoothly because the system itself will frustrate you. If the firm is not for a Chinese, an American, etc, it won't survive. Factories are set up in our communities yet 90% of the beneficiary employees are foreigners.
Our education is such that unless it's a tertiary certificate, you're not competent enough.

![schools](/images/uploads/doug-linstedt-jeeyzsaxbh4-unsplash.webp "Education")

We kill our vocational and technical skills daily. We're interested in taking huge loans to invest in secondary schools but not technical or vocational schools. That's why common pin we can't produce. Even toothpick we have to import. Is there a veil covering our foresight or what? What will drive the industry if not the technical, vocational and technological skills? We know it very well but we're not interested.

![layout](/images/uploads/simon-berger-txxio3aqasg-unsplash.webp "Our setting")

We have copied everything but can't relate it to our setting. We're able to identify how covid 19 is behaving differently on other continents and so we're deploying our own homemade solutions, why can't we do same for other things. It's the same virus but the approach is different. It's the same education but why can't our implementations be different? It's the same democracy and governance, why can't we do it to suit our culture, it's the same industry but why can't we own and make it ours?

![continent](/images/uploads/screenshot_20200606-100346_1591438843689.webp "Africa")

We can develop homemade solutions for covid but cannot find a roadmap for the continent. If this is not madness, someone should tell me what it is?
