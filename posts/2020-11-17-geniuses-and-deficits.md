Everybody is a genius, and everybody is not a genius.

> Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing it is stupid – Albert Einstein.

Here are some few perceptions that help explain the idea of genius:

### Genius is something that is very intimidating but also get thrown around loosely.

At one [environment](https://www.griotdigest.com/blogs/resilience/2020/11/roles-of-conditional-environment), you will find yourself limited of ingenious moments – that is for sure and is a deficit, and it's intimidating. 

While at a different environment, you are displaying all sorts of geniuses on most activities.

A footballer cannot punch like Mohammed Ali – that is obvious but fundamentally makes all the difference.

There is a power in being able to make something complex understandably simple to others and that power is called....genius.

Everybody have this. Differently.

There is also a power that prevents you from making another complex thing understandably simple to others.

This is a deficit. It's in all of us.

### Like beauty, genius is an instance and it has less to do with you.

Beauty fades. It is for a moment, but it can last for a long-while.

So as genius. It is an event, an aha! moment, but it can also get consistency.

When successive genius events are occurring, they become consistency.

And when consistency continues, it's a lifestyle.

The part which is less to do with you is about appreciation.

Beauty is appreciative....we know that...we're never beautiful for our own. It is in the eye of the beholder, not the beholden.

So is  ingenious events.

The essence of genius when it comes to other people perceiving it has less to do with you and more to do with them.

The effects of your ingenious moments is not for you yourself.

For the audience.

You cannot, yourself appreciate your genius on a large scale – you need them – the audience.

### Genius is not a talent.

You can use beautiful things to grace an event.

You can also use your talent ingeniously.

The ingredient that glow out your talent for everyone to spot and appreciate in awe: GENIUS.

Genius is a talent awe-inspiring, cuts across every field.

### Genius is a skill....you can learn it.

> I am certainly of opinion that genius can be acquired... – Aleister Crowley.

In fact I am (me) tempted to call it "The Master Skill". 

We know we can be skillful averagely.

We also know we can be skillful ingeniously.

In both we got, The Average Skill and The Master Skill (Genius).

It takes learning, concentration and development to be masterful in our skills.

From events (aha moments) to consistency, then LIFESTYLE.

### Genius is not a complete model.

If you acquired a genius status or you you show off a genius lifestyle around your environment, that does not signal that you will not fail often.

A world-class striker also goes goalless in some matches.

The world is a playground.... and we're playing in the midst of forces beyond skills and talents. Some are unseen (I believe).

Failure is just a juice that keeps us whet for the world-class.

Well, the only place we are not supposed to fail is the school – that is why the juice is not even there. 

Apart from school and some corrosive environments, you don't have to be irritated when you are failing almost all the time.

Even if you have some few geniuses in you.

### To conclude,

Here is a summary of our genius thoughts.

- Like beauty, genius is a diamond and can only fully be appreciated by those around us – the audience.

-  Like beauty, genius fades. But it can be sustained by consistency and thus becoming a lifestyle.

- You can use your talent in ingenious ways. This requires learning, concentration and consistency.

- If you are perfect that doesn't mean you are without weakness. You will still fail most of the times.


What do you think?

We're in the world to play around.

We play against different hosts of forces at different levels of life.

But we are made for scoring goals – for winning.
