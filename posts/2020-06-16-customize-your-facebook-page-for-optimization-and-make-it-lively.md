For a while ago, it seemed, Facebook was only a scam for marketers. You would create a page and promote ("boost") it only to find a minimal increase in likes and engagement. Facebook must have realized marketers were catching on because today, Facebook Pages greatly do benefit businesses. I gathered some tips on how to customize your Facebook page to get the maximum possible result in terms of engagement and reach. Let's just look at them.

### 1. Take advantage on page templates

If your business goal is to sell something, gain a following, foster a community or showcase your venues or services, there is a page template for your business needs.

Page template is a feature that allows you to quickly streamline your page and gear it towards whatever business you're running. The reason for you to pick a specific template rather than a generic one is because of your business goals and the information you want to display.

For instance, as a writer, you'll probably don't want to inform potential clients of your working hours but rather, you'll want to send them emails or drive them to your site. So a call-to-action (CTA) button on the page would be nice.

Whatever is your business need concerning your Facebook page, it's specific and not generic.

To change your page template to a specific one, go to **more,** then **edit page,** and then **templates**. From there you can take the **edit button** for you to select a new template.

### 2. Using Insights to determine what's working and not working for your page

Checking your page Insights will help you deliver to your followers what they want. It also helps you to know why people are following you in the first place.

For instance, if you notice that the posts with images have better **reach** and **engagement** than plain ol' text (which is true). Try removing the images and see what happens next or adding images to those without images and see the results.

With engagement, there are so many key metrics to discover from your page insights apart from page **Likes**. Some of them are, **the clicks to your website**, **phone number clicks**, **page button clicks**. Your can also get insights about the events you creates and stats on your stories. Checking your page insights will help you stay on track and deliver well to your fans.

### 3. Configure your timeline posting preferences.

If your page timeline get a lot of critical comments then it might be a good idea to check your wall-posting ability.

While it's good to allow open access to a page and even leave negative posts so that your customers can see how you take care of criticisms, I'll recommend to allow posting from others but review before they are published to the page. With that you'll be able to control what gets in. Because some posts will likely not be related to what your page is about.

To do this:

1. On your PC, go to your **page admin panel**.
2. Then at top right, take **edit page info or settings**.
3. Then take **General** at top left.
4. You'll then go **visitor posts.**
5. From there you'll be able to configure how you want it to be.

### 4. Configure your featured likes

Liking other business pages helps you build connections and when they reciprocate, it gives you added exposure. The pages you like are randomly displayed on your timeline. Five at an instance.

You might want only certain pages that are related to your business to be featured and displayed to your audience.

To do this, on your PC, go to your **admin panel** and then **settings**. Next select **featured** form the left menu. Then you can select as many pages as you want to feature on your page. The deselected ones will no longer appear on the page again.

### 5. Your Page is not a substitute

While your Facebook page is an avenue to showcase your business, it's not a replacement for your home page on the internet.

Your own website is the only place where you have complete and utter control of what your contents look like and what is telling people. Your Facebook page is just part of the whole ecosystem of your brand or business.

Your website should be the online central unit (OCU) to your business. If you already have a website then that's likely your business home and that's great. But if you don't have a website yet, consider going live. You might want to[ hire me](https://delanyobott.com).

### 6. Configure your Username

You have to configure a real and nice username for your page url (or link) to be friendly. The best way to to do this is to use your company name and probably adding a keyword to it. And try to avoid numbers in it.

Usernames only have a maximum of 50 characters. You really shouldn’t need that many characters anyway. If you use the maximum number of characters then you’re trying too hard. It should be at least five characters or it won’t work. And at most 13 characters long.

### 7. Take advantage of the cover photo

Create a promotional image as cover that features your services. Your cover can speak louder than anything else on your page.

You can even use a video or a slide of images. You can select up to five images as slides. Basically the cover should be a dynamic content on your page.

### 8. Assign Page Roles

Facebook allows five different page roles: Admin, Editor, Moderator, Advertiser and Analyst. Each role has different capabilities—only admin have the ability to change roles. You can assign roles to as many people as you see fit. Before you assign your team members or employees to a page role, make sure to establish a guideline for accessing and managing the page. Try to check the following;

1. **Define the concept of your page:** Each one of us has a unique voice, but when it comes to representing a business or brand especially on the internet, the admins should work together to establish a consistent voice or concept. Make sure each of the admins understands and use that tone when posting or engaging with users and followers online.
2. **Keep an open communication between admins:** Whether responding to a particularly difficult user comment or sharing an article on the timeline, establish a rule of thumb that if any admin is unsure about whether something is appropriate, she/he should ask another admin for an opinion. Encouraging page admins to have open communication with one another is a sure key and will help reduce mistakes.
3. **Try having a Facebook (or social media) monthly, quarterly or annually training session:** With that you can discuss roles and address expectations with your team. At those meetings you can discuss new features, social media trends, and talk about previous posts. You can also have discussion on new strategies to implement. Having a social media team and conducting regular meetings or training sessions is a good way to run your business on social media platforms.
