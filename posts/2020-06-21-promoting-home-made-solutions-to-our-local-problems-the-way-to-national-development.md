Locally Mechanized Inventions To Promote Hand-Washing As A Means Of
Preventing Infections.

This mechanized locally-made Hand-Washing system is designed and constructed by a young man by name Sims Enyce, a second-year Science student at Legon Presbyterian Boys Senior High School (PRESEC). He's of the view that, as compared to the various similar systems being produced locally using Veronica buckets and wood or metal stands/frames, his method is safer as the user touches nothing with the hands.

Apart from the safety of not getting in contact with the system so as not to contaminate it nor get contamination from it, it is very economical as it is made basically from household junks. In addition, the design makes the system very durable as compared to the lot in itâ€™s category. These are some of the designs from other inventors:

The system uses a foot pedal for operation which is not alien to the other designs we've seen so far but he took things a bit further by applying a complete pulley system to the operational system. He also applied a valve control system to regulate the water flow. This valve is attached to the tap and there on, connected to the pulley system. Thus, when the force is applied to the system via the foot pedal, the pulley system opens the valve and the water flows. Watch the video below for this new and unique system....

For a detailed review on the system as regarding the steps for the whole process (tutorials), I'll share it when he published the video on it in his second upload. Watch, subscribe and share to support local interventions to domestic problems. See you soon.
