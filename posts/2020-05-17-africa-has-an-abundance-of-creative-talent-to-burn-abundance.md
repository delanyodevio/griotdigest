I have always felt there was something wrong🤔 with either the African
continent or her people. I couldn't tell where the problem was coming from
until I read Matthew 25:14:30 and I said eureka!🕺🏼

This scripture talks about the parable of the talents. Talents that were given to servants by their master when he was traveling. On his return, some servants were able to multiply their talents and some were not.

Our problem on this continent has been how to multiply our talents to our benefit. If we say Africans are not talented, it's a scam. We have and are talented. There is a saying that, out of the abundance of water, the fool is still thirsty. Our inability to use the talents have made us to lack everything🤦🏻, whiles we have everything and still have nothing 🤷🏻. Some people argue that the white🤴🏽💂 man have taken everything from us during slavery, that's the cause of our problem. It's not true because we're not the only countries or continent that have gone through slavery so how come the rest have gone pass it. And are now giants while we're still licking our wounds and crying over spilt milk😥.

This covid 19 pandemic has really exposed us negatively and positively. Negatively because we now realize we have nothing and if not that this virus has been merciful on us, we would have all been wiped out⚰ of this continent. Positively because we are now thinking out of the box🎁🎉. Yes, thanks to corona virus, we're now solution oriented. The part that makes me happy most is the way kids are beginning to think of #solutions! Our syllabus has always been theory, chew and pour, exams cycle. But now that we're faced with real problems, we're not looking for examination solutions but real ones. I didn't know we could even produce PPEs😷🧤🧦🧥. These are basic things we've been importing🚢. I didn't know we could produce the sanitizers, even trying ventilators. I didn't know our scientists🔬 could be this serious and do deep research. I didn't know our herbalists could be looking for medications🍵 to cure other diseases other than koko and infertility. In fact I didn't know we could care so much about hygiene since that's one area we least cared about. I didn't know we knew and could do all these. Since those who feed us are also looking for a haven, we've been forced to feed ourselves👍🏼.

Kids are no longer going to school and I can see some of them trying to create little things on their own🎭🎨. They now have the time to think outside the box. They're thinking of things other than just ABCD and exams📚. Some are creating hand washing things🚰, masks🎭, etc. They're thinking of how to help fight civic 19,⚔ they're thinking of solutions💃🏻🙌🏼🕵🏼😊😙. And this is what we have been missing all along. We have just been sitting on our talents all these years whiles others are busily multiplying theirs📷📸💡📖📡🔭💰🔑💉🗜. Yet we complain to our master (creator) of how unfair he has been. We blame our slave masters for our woes, blame our forefathers for all the wrongs but have forgotten to blame ourselves for our mental laziness🤦🏻.

I will not blame any white man🙅🏻 for our problems because the world is a battle field⚔, you either choose to rule🔫 or be ruled🔗. We have allowed ourselves to be ruled so until we decide otherwise, we will be ruled.

All of these shows that Africa's problem is not external but internal (mental laziness and greed). We have just not exploited👷🏼🗜🛠 our gifts🤷🏻. It's time to utilize all the cells in our brains🧠🔋📡🔬🔭🔎📚📊🌍🚗🛣🛠🗜🔨🔧🔩 to our advantage and blame no one because only we ourselves have the key🔐🔑. To Africa's greatness. What do you think? Let me know in the comment below.
